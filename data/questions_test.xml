			<RelQSubject>Can u beleive it ?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>cOPIED fROM A CIRCULATED MAIL I cannot stop myself from sharing this with all of you. Its all started when I received a call from someone claiming that he was from my mobile service provider and he asked me to shutdown my phone for 2 hours for 3G update to take place. As I was rushing for a meeting; I did not question and shutdown my cell phone. After 45 minutes I felt very suspicious since the caller did not even introduce his name. I quickly turned on my cell phone and I received several calls from my family members and the others were from the number that had called me earlier - 3954380. I called my parents and I was shocked that they sounded very worried asking me whether I am safe. My parents told me that they had received a call from someone claiming that they had me with them and asking for money to let me free. The call was so real and my parents even heard 'my voice' crying out loud asking for help. My parent was at the bank waiting for next call to proceed for money transfer. I told my parents that I am safe and asked them to lodge a police report. Right after that I received another call from the guy asking me to shutdown my cell phone for another 1 hour which I refused to do and hu ng up. They keep calling my cell phone until the battery had run down. I myself lodged a police report and I was informed by the officer that there were many such scams reported. MOST of the cases reported that the victim had already transferred the money! And it is impossible to get back the money. Be careful as this kind of scam might happened to any of us!!! Those guys are so professional and very convincing during calls. If you are asked to shut down your cell phone for updates by the service provider; ASK AROUND! Your family or friends might receive the same call. Be Safe and Stay Alert! Please pass around to your famil y and friends!</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Plans for cap on expat job tenure</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>From Friday's Peninsula: No plans for cap on expat job tenure DOHA: Qatar values its expatriate workforce and has no plans to emulate Saudi Arabia&#8217;s example and pack off long-staying foreign workers. A Saudi Minister last week hinted at his government&#8217;s plans not to renew job visas of expatriate workers after six years. Other GCC countries have occasionally looked at similar policies. &#8220;We categorically rule out any plans to refuse to renew job visas for long-staying expatriate workers;&#8221; the source said. The daily also quoted a number of nationals as saying they were against packing off long-staying and experienced expatriate workers as that would mean a major blow to the Qatari economy. Nearly all key sectors of the economy would be severely affected if expatriate workers are to leave after six years. A national said the worst-affected would be the education sector; for instance; where a majority of teachers are foreigners.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Naah not really.. The main character in this joke is new somewhere though.. A man moves into a nudist colony. He receives a letter from his grandmother asking him to send her a current photo of himself in his new location. Too embarrassed to let her know that he lives in a nudist colony; he cuts a picture in half and mails it. The next day he discovers that he had accidentally sent the bottom half of the photo. He's really worried but then remembers how bad his grandmother's eyesight is; and hopes she won't notice. A few weeks later; he receives a letter from his Grandmother. It says: "Thank you for the picture. Change your hairstyle... it makes your nose look too short." Love; Grandma</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Dubai 4 U</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Dubai: A police lieutenant colonel; six lieutenants and six officers have been referred to court on charges of using torture and extensive beatings during an interrogation which allegedly led to the death of a Pakistani man and left two others with injuries. Prosecutors levelled a number of charges against the 13 Dubai Police personnel; varying from abuse of power; unlawful detention of the deceased B.K. and his two compatriots; torture; extensive use of force during interrogation; forgery and giving a false statement during official questioning by a public prosecutor. Dubai Police's forensic doctor testified that B.K. died after being badly beaten which left him with acute bleeding in his brain. B.K.'s injured compatriots were identified as S.H.; 38; and M.S.; 33. According to the forensic doctor's prosecution statement; M.S. sustained burns which were caused by a chemical substance used to remove rust. "There were bruises; cuts and injuries over different parts of his body as well. Due to the severe and extensive beating; M.S. suffered a critical kidney failure. Meanwhile S.H. was beaten by hands and ghutras [head dress cord worn by local men] and kicked;" the doctor claimed. The 13 suspects; including nine Emiratis; two Pakistanis and two Omanis; are scheduled to appear before the Dubai Court of First Instance on May 31. According to the charges sheet; prosecutors accused the brigadier; four lieutenants and four officers; with unlawfully locking up B.K. in Naif police station. Records said B.K.; M.S. and S.H. were allegedly wanted for an investigation related to a kidnapping case that caused death. Dubai Police Chief Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan Tamim earlier told Gulf News that if the investigation uncovered negligence or culpability; those involved would have to face the law. An Eritrean ambulance paramedic testified that she and her colleagues were asked to head to Naif police station because there was a problem. "We were not informed what happened. When we reached there; I saw B.K. on the floor. He had bruises on his body. He was already dead although we tried to resuscitate him and gave him five electric shocks&#8230; but it was too late."</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>BUYING A NEW KIA CAR?......THINK AGAIN!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>If you&#8217;re thinking of buying a new Kia car then think again! I have recently bought one in fact I have just taken it for its first (1000km) service. The car had a problem with the door handle and needed replacing. They said they had fixed it with lubrication but needless to say as soon as I inspected it; it was still the same! It took a stand up row with the supervisor at AL_ATTIYA Motors (Industrial area) to get him to order the part so that the door handle could be replaced (it still has not been replaced). ALSO...I left just under a &#188; tank of fuel in the car. When I picked the car up the following day; the fuel tank was TOTALLY empty with the display showing that I had 0 km to go before the tank was dry! There were no extra km on the odometer so the car must have been left &#8216;ticking over&#8217; for HOURS on end to exhaust the fuel. The car manual specifically says that the engine should not be left idling for longer than 3 minutes before 2000km!!! You would think that the &#8216;mechanics&#8217; would know this. I was worried about taking the car because I was concerned that I would run out of fuel....the supervisor seemed unconcerned and offered no explanation. Luckily my wife was with me in her car and we did make it to the nearest garage...which took us out of our way home!! IS THIS ACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE?</RelQBody>

I worked for only 3 wks in this facility but due to some unfavorable working conditions in this company/facility; I decided to resign after only working for 3 wks. They did not give my documents. I will be leaving qatar on Oct 19; 2010 but the day before my flight I will have an interview with another company and hopefully will pass my interview. My question is will it be possible for me to enter again Qatar with my new employer? I still don't have an ID and haven't finger printed yet since I will be leaving qatar before my 1 month of stay here. Please enlighten me about this matter. Your help is much appreciated.

All the classes are to be held on the ground floor of the building. 4. A fully functional water sprinkling system. 5. Practice a fire drill as often as possible This is a VERY low cost nursery but all this was done ASAP regardless of the cost. Now how can a nursery as expensive as gympanzies have been running without all that; how and who approved them to operate&#8230; Yes we are looking for someone to blame but the management is almost fully to be blamed &#8220;i won&#8217;t go on as who wants to be deported to our good forsaken countries for freedom of speech. Brings me to the other point how is it almost everyone heard and is still hearing updates from international media &#8220;I was on my way there when I got a call from my husband that there is a fire at Villagio who heard it on BBC news&#8230;</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>DUBAI: In a bid to reform its labour market; the UAE has introduced a new work permit which will allow foreign workers; including Indians; in the country to switch jobs after two years without facing a six-month ban for leaving their work. Expatriate workers in the UAE who have received a six-month ban on leaving their jobs recently will be able to obtain new work permits from the beginning of the new year; a senior official has said. The new work permit will be issued only if they have completed two years with their former employers; Humaid Bin Deemas; Acting Director-General at the Ministry of Labour; said.</RelQBody>

Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso both picked up second yellow cards for time-wasting in the late stages of the club's 4-0 win at Ajax. That means they will miss the last group G game against Auxerre; but the match is irrelevant as Real have already qualified as winners.

			<RelQSubject>Source of our problems .. ?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>A group of alumni; highly established in their careers; got together to visit their old university lecturer. Conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee; the lecturer went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and an assortment of cups: porcelain; plastic; glass; some plain-looking and some expensive and exquisite; telling them to help themselves to hot coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand; the lecturer said: "If you noticed; all the nice-looking; expensive cups were taken up; leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. "While it is but normal for you to want only the best for yourselves; that is the source of your problems and stress". What all of you really wanted was coffee; not the cup; but you consciously went for the better cups and are eyeing each other's cups. Now; if Life is coffee; then the jobs; money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain Life; but the quality of Life doesn't change. Sometimes; by concentrating only on the cup; we fail to enjoy the coffee in it. So don't let the cups drive you...enjoy the coffee instead.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Hi all; I finally received my official letter of appointment from Qatar Airways. But I'm quite curious as to why the photographs I need to submit to the company for administrative purposes must be in a background other than white or gray. I though most countries require a white background for such visa formalities etc.? Just trying to understand the rationale behind it ...</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Exiting Qatar for a working Visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Good day ! I am new here in Doha on Family visit visa; I would like to ask an advise to those who know about this particular hiring process. A Contracting Company here in Doha wants to hire me as a Site Nurse but they want me to exit Qatar and after that they will issue me a working visa. They are requiring me to give them a letter stating that I will be the one to shoulder all my expense on my exit; My question is how can I make sure that they will give me a working visa once I am already outside Qatar ? I will appreciate all your comments. Thank you so much.</RelQBody>

Due to this circumstances I choose my family and I resign to my work. Now I am waiting for the processing of our visa cancellation here in UAE. The blessing now one company in Qatar want to Hire me they send offer letter and the offer is good I can bring my family there. The problem now is that the company want to hire me cant apply visa because I have still active visit visa in Qatar. I have no Idea how to cancel the existing Visa the visa will expire on april which is very long time for them to wait.

According to them they will then apply for my residence permit once I am in Qatar and once I got residence permit put into my passport then they can apply for my family visa and then my family can join me in Qatar. My question is; can my family not come with me in the first place with me when I am going to Qatar. In other words; can company not apply visa for my family as they are now applying for visa? Thanks</RelQBody>

But; when I checked about this idea; people say that it is mandatory to book return tickets for people entering Qatar in visit visa.I can cancel the ticket later but;&#160;they have to have a return trip ticket!!!

			<RelQSubject>Question for Brits moving / moved to Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi folks; I am moving to Qatar in 10 days. My employer (Barwa) just asked me to bring a UK police clearance with a stamp from the ministry of foreign affairs. I assume this is to show proof that there are no legal or criminal convictions against me. I've just been to my local police station who say they won't provide this kind of information. They gave me the contact details for Disclosure Scotland; a govt department; who process these disclosures. Unfortunately this takes about 40 days end to end and I only have 10... Presumably you guys have been through this. Can anyone give me advice one what you did or whether there's a quicker way to get this resolved. Also if I just arrive in Doha; do I need a formal tourist visa for the first month until my work visa is processed; or can I just get one when I arrive at Doha? Many thanks for your advice.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>CBQ sucks</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I am having an account in CBQ which I am going to close very soon. Recently I had an issue where the bank for no reason deducted Qr. 6000 from my account saying credit card settlement whereas I had settled myt credit card on the same day morning. Since then I have been chasing the bank to credit it back and since my credit cards are already cancelled I have no ways to withdraw the excess. The bank always promised the issue will be solved in a couple of hours and now its been 6 days now. If there is any delay from our side the bank makes sure that they charge us with charges and interest.And when delays happen from their side what do we get us compenstion. Its ridicolous and unacceptable but in the end we are helpless. The only alternative for this is to behave to them like the way you would if you were in a market and be rude to them as maximum as possible. From my experience what I understood is that they dont understand professional way of doing things;</RelQBody>

It is almost impossible not to step on a duck; and although they try their best to avoid them; the first woman accidentally steps on one. Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says; 'Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!' The next day; the second woman steps accidentally on a duck and along comes St. Peter; who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman. The third woman has observed all this and; not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man; is very; VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks; but one day St.Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on .... Very tall; long eyelashes; muscular. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word. The happy woman says; 'I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?' The guy says; 'I don't know about you; But I stepped on a Duck.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>snake in cockpit</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Pilot makes emergency landing after finding snake in cockpit A pilot in Australia's Northern Territory was forced to turn his plane around after a snake popped out from behind his dashboard and crawled down his leg. In a freakish in-flight incident immediately likened to the cult Samuel L Jackson 2006 film Snakes on a Plane; the pilot; Braden Blennerhassett; made a mayday call declaring: &#8220;We've got a snake on board.&#8221; "As the plane was landing; the snake was crawling down my leg; which was frightening;" he later told Channel Nine. The snake; which was reportedly chasing a tree frog that had stowed away under the front passenger seat; has still not been found and ground crew have been trying to lure it out with a mouse. Mr Blennerhassett; a charter pilot; was flying to a rural township yesterday to drop off cargo when the snake&#8217;s head poked out of the control panel in front of him. His initial calls to his air company - which were made difficult by the snake's appearance on the transmit button - initially drew a sceptical response until he repeatedly requested a snake handler be ready when he landed. "I've seen it on a movie once; but never in an airplane;" he told ABC</RelQBody>

To live happily ever after involves great risks because in these times we just can&#8217;t sit on our asses and expect our white knight on his horse to fall down from the sky. We have to open ourselves to possibilities and get out of our comfort zones in order to meet people. We just can&#8217;t sleep for a hundred years and expect to be kissed by a prince; unless; of course; if he&#8217;s a comatose patient molester in the case of Sleeping Beauty or a necrophile prince in Snow White&#8217;s. We have to let go of our traumatic experiences with the Pinocchios we dated; our ugly duckling issues and inhibitions. Spread our wings like a swan; go to the ball; leave our glass slippers and hope for the best he&#8217;d call. We are our own fairytale godmothers. We can make things happen for ourselves. And if an evil stepmother or a wicked witch stands in the way; well; just lift up those pretty white gowns and; well; kick the BITCH&#8217;s ASS! For all Modern women out there...</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>I wanted to teach my daughter; who is 4 years old; how important it is to follow the Queue in public places. I wanted to drop the baggage in Lulu hypermarket (Gharaffa) and thought this is the perfect time. I asked my daughter to stand behind the last person and follow the Queue. Poor girl has to stand there for 10 minutes because people will just ignore the Queue and go around her. All sorts of nationalities were doing it (Indians; Nepalese; Arabs; Philippine and Westerners). Finally I went on guard the Queue and directed people to stand behind the girl. Some complied and most of them ignored. My girl came out totally confused and it was so sad. She was not convinced that it is a good idea to stand on Queue. Now please don&#8217;t start bashing on any particular race or nationalities. All were doing it and no excuse at all for that.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Hi; I keep looking at the classified sales in QL and am very amused at the prices people ask for electronic items. WHY O WHY dont people look on the net for the new price before asking for ridiculous prices for second hand items(everyone please note; once you have taken it out of the shop it INSTANTAEOUSLY becomes second hand; it can therefore NOT be sold as new......you get the idea.....) I recently saw a camera (second hand) on QL being sold for a higher price then the new price...... Wake up sellers; look on ebay to get an indication of prices and stop dreaming.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>I have lived/visited in other capitals and motorcycles are always a big part of traffic. Here; you are lucky to see one per day. And that is usually the paper/food delivery guy. First answer will be that it is unsafe. Well; if you climb into a car you had better be a defensive driver and avoid maniacs at all costs. If you do the same on the cycle you will be just as safe. Preventing an accident is much more important than surviving an accident. I I have ridden for 2 years on my cycle and not been touched yet. (And I don't mean the Friday morning cruise with the Harley crowd up to the coffee shop) There are good; cheap; used cycles available over on the classifieds. Kawasaki KLR?</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Wish you all a great week ahead.</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Very nice and a beautiful morning today. Just wanna write something motivational which will help me and many of you as well. Well&#8230; Lemme start with a story which I heard from one of my mentor long back. &#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;Once a young man was trying to do suicide to kill himself and was blaming God and others for not helping him. An greybeard man was hearing his words. Their conversation goes like that. Greybeard Man : Hi Stop please don&#8217;t do that. Young Man : Ohh no Why should I stop. What is life all about . I don&#8217;t have anything to live so its better to die than live with nothing. Greybeard Man : Ok Man. I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your eyes. Young Man : No way I cant live see without my eyes. Greybeard Man : Ok I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your kidneys. Young Man : Ohh no I cant live without my kidneys. Greybeard Man then repeated all the important parts of his body and asked him to sell them for money but the man was continuously denying to do that. Then the greybeard man told the young man that just in your body you are having things which worth millions but still you are ungrateful. Be happy with what you have and do hard work and live your life.&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221; Hence sometimes we just don&#8217;t realize/utilize what we have and just blame others. Sometimes we just see the container and don&#8217;t really understand what really contains in it. So it is better to start every day with a goal to push forward to be a good being. Wish you all great week ahead.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Ode to my True Friend</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>The day I met you I found a friend - And a friendship that I pray will never end. Your smile - so sweet And so bright - Kept me going When day was as dark as night. You never ever judged me; You understood my sorrow. Then you told me it needn't be that way And gave me the hope of a better tomorrow. You were always there for me; I knew I could count on you. You gave me advice and encouragement Whenever I didn't know what to do. You helped me learn to love myself You made life seem so good. You said I can do anything I put my mind to And suddenly I knew I could. There were times when we didn't see eye to eye And there were days when both of us cried. But even so we made it through: Our friendship hasn't yet died. Circumstances have pulled us apart; We are separated by many miles. Truly; the only thing that keeps me going Is my treasured memory of your smile. This friendship we share Is so precious to me; I hope it grows and flourishes And lasts unto infinity. You are so extra-special to me And so this to you I really must tell: You are my one true friend; My Guardian Angel. Our friendship is one-in-a-million So let's hold on to it and each other. We cannot let this chance of pure bliss fly away For there will never be another. I love you. I will always love you.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Joke of the Day ! :)</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>..An Indian man has ended up in jail in Abu Dhabi &#8211; for kissing his then girlfriend at a party in India seven years ago. A photograph of the kiss has been used by the woman&#8217;s husband - who is divorcing her - to prove an affair between the two. The husband claims that affair was rekindled in the UAE last year; Emirates 24/7 reports. The 30-year-old MBA graduate was sentenced to 18 months in jail by the Court of First Instance in Abu Dhabi. After serving six months; the sentence has been suspended pending an appeal. The man; known as Suhail; met his ex-girlfriend; a Pakistani living in the UK; when she went to Mumbai on holiday. They lost touch when she went back to the UK. But they met up again in Abu Dhabi in 2011 after she relocated there with her husband. Suhail claims he did not have a physical relationship with the woman; did not know she was married and did not even know her real name. The husband has filed for divorce in the UK based on the allegations. Source:yahoomaktoob.com</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>How to Transfer my family Visa to new Passport</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Dear Friends; Greetings! Recently i was told at Indian Passport office at India is that spouse name must be endorsed in Parents Passports in order to obtain passport for infant. unfortunately my wife passport does not have spouse name endorsed. Hence the new passport application was rejected for my infant even though i have provided a sworn affidavit from Indian Embassy from Qatar. Now i have left with only option to endorse spouse name in my wife passport. However this will we be a reissue of new passport as per the rule. currently my family passport is having a Valid Qatar RP . Now what all i want to know is do i need to Transfer my Family Visa to Newly issued passport before arriving to Doha or it is not required as it can be done upon arrival to Doha. Please help me to clear the issue. Thanks. Uvaraj.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Its Thursday!!!!!!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>A business man got on an elevator in a building. When he entered the elevator; there was a blonde already inside and she greeted him by saying; "T-G-I-F" (letters only). He smiled at her and replied; "S-H-I-T" (letters only)." She looked at him; puzzled; and said; "T-G-I-F" again. He acknowledged her remark again by answering; "S-H-I-T." The blond was trying to be friendly; so she smiled her biggest smile and said as sweetly as possibly "T-G-I-F" another time. The man smiled back to her and once again replied with a quizzical expression; "S-H-I-T." The blond finally decided to explain things; and this time she said; "T-G-I-F; Thank Goodness It's Friday; get it?" The man answered; "Sorry; Honey; It's Thursday."</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>air hostess stole from passengers</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Good reasons not to fly Air Frog or drink too much ... :O) An air hostess is facing ten years in prison after admitting stealing from business class passengers as they slept on long-haul flights. The 47-year-old was dubbed the &#8216;Mile High Pickpocket&#8217; after being caught following complaints about missing money; credit cards and designer jewellery. She would rifle through pockets and handbags; helping herself to the equivalent of &#163;3;700 in notes on one flight alone. The 47-year-old Air France employee was caught following complaints about missing cash; credit cards and jewellery &#8216;She knew that many of the passengers would fall asleep following a large meal and lots of alcohol. &#8216;This is the time that she would start rifling through their property; helping herself to whatever she could find.&#8217; The defendant; known for legal reasons solely as Lucie R; was finally arrested when she got off a Tokyo to Paris flight at 4.30am last Friday. Police had corroborated her flight rota with the huge number of crimes being reported. When confronted with the evidence against her; she confessed to 26 different thefts; during which everything from antique watches to cheque books were taken. Detectives charged her with the 26 offences while suggesting that numerous other thefts &#8216;undoubtedly took place&#8217;. He said that colleagues had also become suspicious of Lucie R&#8217;s lavish lifestyle. Despite officially earning less than &#163;40;000 a year; she regularly turned up for work in a top-of-the-range sports car and was buying plush apartments close to the airports where she worked. Detectives also raided a bank deposit box in her home town of Rouen; western France; where Lucie R had hidden stolen property including Cartier jewellery. The woman is currently in custody in Paris and is expected to appear before examining magistrates later this week. Source: DAily Mail</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Advice on good schools for my 9 year old and 16 year old</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I am in need of recent information on schooling for my 9 year old and 16 year old. I plan to move over in August so will require (places permitting) information on which schools are recommended. My 16 year old would be studying her A levels and my 9 year old would be starting in year 5. I would prefer them to be in the same school; however understand that this may mot be possible. I have already had a message from Doha College to say my 9 year old is on a list and IF shortlisted will then have to sit a test and if passed would be offered a place. I am concerned that if a place does not come up soon or if he doesnt pass the test I would be stuck without a place and would then have to find a different school. Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Family residence visa meeting with captain</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Dear Ql friends; My husband had applied for my resident visa which was rejected and then he was told to come for committee interview in madinat khalifa. one day before the meeting he got a call saying that the meeting will not be in madinat khalifa but we have to go to mesaimeer centre and meet Captain ABC between 7 am to 7 30 am. We (My husband and me)arrived at the mesaimeer centre at 6:45 am. tried to meet Captain ABC in his office on first floor and one of the service staff guided us to the reception(since he was busy in another meeting). They said to wait outside counter no XX. My husband kept waiting outside the counter in line while the guard let all local people go in first and told us we can go after they are over with work. After waiting for two hours in the women's waiting area ;I decided to look for the Captain in his office again while my husband still waiting in queue outside counter. Luckily this time i met the captain and explained what i was there for. He said we were late and i had to explain him for a while that we were waiting outside the counter on ground floor. He then asked me to call my husband to his office .He then took us to a room for a video conferencing with a senior person while three other captains were in the room. The interview lasted for 2 mins in which they just asked my husband about his salary and how he was today :) The captain then said check status after three days. Its difficult to wait and i hope such a short interview doesnt mean that our application is rejected. P:S I know I wrote a long note but we dont want anybody else to go through the same problem. Incase you are called for interview to meet certain captain at mesaimeer centre; Please do not wait at the counter; but directly go and look for the captains room on the first floor. Otherwise you will be late and you def dont want to upset the captain. hoping for a positive response for the visa :/</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>UAE Scraps 6 Month Re-Entry Ban!!!!!!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>ABU DHABI -- The Ministry of Interior yesterday withdrew the "six-month ban" system imposed by the Immigration and Residency authorities on various categories of workers upon the cancellation of expatriates' employment visa. The decision; that will have a major impact and implications on the UAE labour market; has come into force with immediate effect. The Naturalisation and Residency Departments stopped stamping the ban on passports while processing cancellation of employment visas. Ahmed Al Hamadi; in-charge of Passport Office at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; said: "We received a letter from the Immigration and Residency Department with instructions from Interior Minister Lt-Gen. Shaikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan not to stamp the ban on applications for cancelling visas. The decision was put into effect yesterday when we cancelled employment visas without imposing the ban." He said the office received hundreds of applications yesterday; which were processed without slapping the six-month ban. For employers; it will now be easier to hire talents from within the country. For the millions of expats working in various capacities; barring maids; the news should come as manna from heaven; for there would now be free movement of workforce in the country. Employers can get the best talent available in the market without the hassle of seeking the "No Objection Certificate" from the current sponsor. Ministry sources told Khaleej Times that under instructions from Lt.-Gen. Shaikh Saif; the ministry circulated the decree among all Immigration and Residency Departments in the country; and that the decision came into effect yesterday. On the categories included in the decree; the official said only housemaids were excluded for the time being; and that a special committee would be set up to study their case. "Housemaids were not included in the decision. A special panel will be formed to study the possibilities of exempting this category also from the ban;" said the official. He said the decision was in line with Cabinet Decree No. 18 of 2005 on sponsorship transfer of employees in the private sector; under which a fee of Dh1;500 for masters and doctorate holders; Dh3;000 for bachelors degree holders and Dh5;000 for certificates lower than bachelors degree would be levied. A special panel comprising senior officials had been set up in February to look into various aspects of streamlining the residence and labour market laws. Hitherto; only those who met the requisite conditions for sponsorship transfer; including consent of sponsor; completion of one-year in a company and a valid residence visa; among others; were eligible to change jobs within the country without getting their passports stamped with the six-month ban. In practice; however; movement of labour force was virtually impossible with hardly any sponsor willing to write out a no objection certificate. Meanwhile; most employees and employers who were processing their applications at the ministry yesterday; seemed overwhelmed by the decision and welcomed the measure which they said was bound to improve labour relations. Ahmed Ibrahim; an investor; said: "the decision is excellent. It will spare employees the hassles they face with employers."Abdul Jalil Rahma; owner of Noon Contracting and Construction Company; said : "The ban was never in favour of employees. Scrapping the ban will free employees of the threat posed by some employers; leading to relinquishment of their entitlements in favour of release." While most of the GCC countries trying their best to reduce the hassles of employees; here in Doha; some were requested to increase the re-entry ban to 5 years. The sponsorship system and re-entry ban are always making the employees in Doha more depressed. Still wonder we are in the modern world with consider human values; their freedom.....</RelQBody>

I just want know is it still possible for me to go to Qatar with a visit visa even if they cannot find a person with the same surname? Please help; need an advise. Thanks in advance!</RelQBody>

So what I did is that I used petroleum jelly instead of oil since this was also the advice from my previous dermatologist in my home town. I've been using this daily every 2 hours just to moisturised my hands. but when I went back to the finger printing dept. and after waiting for several hours in queued the man whom I was assigned as to do the finger printing just look at my hands and told me to come back for another week. my hands were still a little moistened by the jelly that I was using. Does his eyes similar to that of the machine. He didn't even try placing my hand in the machine.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Woman in a Pet shop</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>A woman went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large; beautiful parrot. There was a sign on the cage that said $50.00. "Why so little?" she asked the pet store owner. The owner looked at her and said; "Look; I should tell you first that this bird used to live in a brothel and sometimes it says some pretty vulgar stuff." The woman thought about this; but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She took it home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room and waited for it to say something. The bird looked around the room; then at her; and said; "New house; new madam." The woman was a bit shocked at the implication; but then thought; "That's really not so bad." When her two daughters returned from school the bird saw them and said; "New house; new madam; new girls." The girls and the woman were a bit offended but then began to laugh about the situation considering how and where the parrot had been raised. Moments later; the woman's husband came home from work. The bird looked at him and said; "Hi; Keith!" Funeral services for Keith was performed a couple days later :)</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>What's the real reason for FAMILY VISA rejection?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Most of us are expats here in Qatar. We are living under their beautiful culture. As I stayed here for almost a year; I can see that most of them are Family oriented which is I found it amazing. But how come it&#8217;s really hard for those who apply for FAMILY VISA approval / RP? If you don&#8217;t belong to those lucky NATIONALITIES; your application will be rejected for sure. It&#8217;s crappy and racism. I know a lot of who applied for their Family Visa and got rejected. Most of them are earning well. Above 10;000QR basic; when they asked the officer in the Immigration why it was rejected; they can&#8217;t give them a good answer. Maybe they can&#8217;t tell it straight to the point that their nationality is FILIPINO; INDIAN; PAKISTANI or NEPALI etc. They don&#8217;t have choice but to send their kids back to their countries because they can&#8217;t get approval. I pity those kids who needs to be with their parents and have a whole family. Their parent/s should stay here because they need to work. Inshallah; they will change the system here when it comes for applying family visa approval / RP as this is a Family oriented country. No matter from which part of the world you are as long as you can support to have a family here.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Crash averted with minute to spare</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>CHENNAI: A mid-air collision between two flights over Tiruchi was averted at the last minute on Saturday when a Chennai-Madurai Air India flight and a Thiruvananthapuram-Chennai Jet Airways flight came too close. There were 173 passengers on board the two flights. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) alarm went off in the cockpits of both the aircraft at 1.15pm while they were flying at 16;000 feet over Tiruchi. TCAS issued a &#8216;resolution advisory&#8217; which means the flights were one minute away from colliding with one another. Air India IC 671 flight had 118 passengers and Jet Airways 9W 2758 flight had 55 passengers on board. Sources said the AI flight was descending to land at Madurai airport while Jet Airways aircraft was on a course of ascent after taking off from Thiruvananthapuram airport. &#8216;&#8216;Both the aircraft were given different routes; but somehow the flights came close when the AI flight was told to descend for landing at Madurai airport. The AI aircraft was supposed to descend on a different track. We are yet to pinpoint the error;&#8217;&#8217; said a source. Soon after the warning was sounded in the cockpits; the pilots corrected the course and averted a major accident. The air traffic was being controlled by Thiruvananthapuram air traffic control.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Doctor raped woman;</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Doctor raped woman; court told September 29; 2010 04:37:59 PMA+ A-| || An Australian doctor allegedly raped a woman seven times in one night; a jury has been told. The Victoria woman claimed that Arvind Sharma raped her feigned and that she had passed out after he allegedly attacked her in an attempt to stop his actions; a Victorian County Court jury heard. Sharma pleaded not guilty to seven counts of rape and three of indecent assault arising from the alleged incident in December 2006 at his Bendigo home. He claims the sex was consensual. Opening the Crown case; prosecutor Jim Bessell told the jury of 10 men and two women that Sharma and the complainant were known to each other and had previously had sex. He said the woman had told Sharma she felt unwell after drinking a Midori and lemonade while they were nightclubbing with friends. They had argued about returning to his house. After lying on his bed; the woman again argued with Sharma and rolled away from him; wanting to go to sleep; Mr Bessell said. He said that the woman felt Sharma's hands on her side and he began rubbing her side: ''She knew this action suggested he indicated interest in having sex'' but she declined his advances; Mr Bessell said. The alleged attack on the woman began when she was close to sleep; the prosecutor said; but she stayed still ''as though passed out; in the hope that he would think she was out of it and he would stop''. The woman was raped seven times and indecently assaulted three times; Mr Bessell told the jury; saying that Sharma had been ''rough'' with her. Before the pair went out; the woman had dropped an overnight bag off; intending to stay the night; Mr Bessell said. After Sharma fell asleep following the alleged incident; she text messaged a friend; who took her to the police station. Defence counsel Rodney Willcox said while both Sharma and the woman had been drinking; both were aware of what was going on. He said Sharma did not undress the woman against her will; but both had undressed themselves. ''The defence say there was no rape and indeed; there was no indecent assault;'' Mr Willcox told the jury. ''She did not at any stage object from the alleged incidents. She did not voice her concern; she didn't leave the house at any stage during; or immediately after; the alleged incident. ''She was aware and she was alert and she pretended to be asleep.'' Mr Bessell said the woman could recall seeing the flash of Sharma's mobile phone camera while he was allegedly assaulting her; even though her eyes were closed. The trial before Judge Frank Shelton continues today.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Isrel destroyed Syria nuclear reactor</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Israel destroyed Syria nuclear reactor: WikiLeaks Dec 24; 2010 at 11:55 Views (16245) | | | 18 | | WikiLeaks to publish 'sensitive' Israel cables: TV By AFP JERUSALEM - Israel destroyed a Syrian nuclear reactor in an air raid just weeks before it went online in 2007; said a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks and published on Friday in an Israeli daily. "On September 6; 2007; Israel destroyed the nuclear reactor built by Syria secretly; apparently with North Korea's help;" then US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice wrote in the cable published in Yediot Aharonot newspaper. "Our intelligence experts are convinced that the attack targeted by the Israelis is in fact an atomic reactor of the same type built by North Korea in Yongbyon;" she wrote in the message dated April 2008. "We have good reason to believe that the reactor was not built for peaceful purposes;" she said; adding the attack came only weeks before the reactor was to become operational. Rice also noted the secrecy surrounding the construction of the nuclear facility; with the Syrian authorities refusing to invite the International Atomic Energy Agency or any media to inspect the site. Syria has always denied that the structure targeted by Israeli warplanes was a nuclear reactor; although it has admitted it was a "military site under construction." Israel has for its part never denied that its air force attacked a target in Syria; without ever officially claiming responsibility for the action. Former US president George W. Bush recounted in his memoirs that he resisted Israeli pressure to bomb the site. In 2008; current US President Barack Obama said when he was a Democratic hopeful for the White House that Israel was right to bomb the suspected nuclear facility in Syria.</RelQBody>

And in this country there is a lady from another nationality but she is there for to work and for to care her 2 kids without father. She have good position in company she have good salary if u compare with her own country. She is very happy because she is healthy she can care her family she have good job and she is giving her everything to company even some nights she is working at home for company. At That company the GM have a son who have down sendrom but only 25% because he can use computer ; cameras ; all office machines and even he have account on facebook. But this guy when grew he starts the sexual harasment to this lady. And the lady inform the GM about this many times. But GM doesnt give up to bring his son to office. One day he is doing really bad things to her and she is calling the call center of police station. After tell everything also she says i dont want to work for this company anymore. Call center says ok dont work go out now and go to nearest police station for to complain.She do what the police said her and goes to police station. First time the police doesnt want to accept her complain because the GM`s son is sick. After long hours they accept the complain. She gives 4 witness name and 1 cd and they open a case. Also she says there i dont want to work for this company anymore. The police says ok dont work there is no problem until finish the case. And she goes back to home which company provided for her. And she is not living in a room. Company gives a flat for her. a few days later she goes to prosecution for to check case. But prosecution calls only 2 witness and they close the case. and she has made an appeal of this case. And the lady asked why u didnt call other witness. and sure this witness will not say the truth because also they are working for same GM after it The GM can kick out them. And at prosecution they accept this. Lady while wait the decision from prosecution one evening goes to home and what she see. Her door broken and lock changed. Then she calls her GM and asks to her why u r doing this to me. The GM says i didnt do police did. then she goes to police station for to ask about this. And the police catch her there and they send her to jail. In that jail everything going very slow but for her everything is going very fast. and in 2 days The court decides for to deport her. And in decision they write she caught while work for another company and the judge asked her did u escape from your company are you working for another company and according the decision she says yes i was working for another company and the police caught me there.in this time again prosecution close the case without calling the witness. after this; the lady wants to complain about this case but she needs a lawyer. she wants to hire a lawyer but for letter of attorney she should to wait 1 week because the lawyer cant see her for to take signature. After 1 week she gives signature and the lawyers open another case for this. The judge wants to file from jail for to see everything and he gives a letter for to send jail. But jail doesnt send the file to court. after 1 week again the judge gives another letter for to recieve that file but again the jail doesnt send to court. and she lives in the jail while happening all this outside. and this little story to be continue and how it will finish who knows :)</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>In trouble--Need advice -- Renting</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>here is my situation. On August 29 ; I saw an ad on Qatar living for a apartment to be rented in Al Sadd for 8000 QAR. The ad specifically said no comission. I went to see the apartment ; the current tenant just moved in first of August ; and needs to vacate the premises closer to his job ; and needs to find a replacement tenant to take over the lease. I agreed. Then one day before signing the contract with the LANDLORD ; I receive a call from the current tenant informing me that he paid commission to the person who assisted him in finding the apartment ; and that I need to pay him part of the comssion since he only lived there for a month. I thought bout it ; if i disagree ; he will find another renter. So I said ok . Then I signed the contract with the landlord ; and there is no mention of commission on the contract . Now I am living in the new apartment. Do I have to pay the previous tenant the comission ; since I already agreed ; depsite the ad in qatar living saying no comission and also the contract i signed doesnt mention any comission ; the previous tenant said he is not liable for the comission as he only lived there for a few weeks. Please help.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>American driver license is not convertible!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>okay; I heard this from other sources; but today it was confirmed. I went to the DL office; and my company's govt official talked with several ppl; including manager; and they would not convert. Rules have changed within the last month. A coworker; who is British; got it converted last week; so this is only for Americans... figure that! Sucks heavily because if anything; British and other right-hand-side drivers should be tested! Must be some retribution! So; basically; your options as an American are to go to school and bypass all the schooling and get a test. The test could be a month off! You can plead for something sooner and you may get lucky. But it seems most ppl recommend that you take the minimum 12-day schooling as the tests are totally weird! The school guy was saying only 5% ppl make it through (with grain of salt considering the guy is working for the school). There is a L-test; where you go up a slope; have to stop; then keep going without slipping (on a manual car). Then you have to reverse. Then there is a front-parking. There is no pocket parking or reverse parking. So; its not as bad as it used to be. Well; fellow Americans; it was good until it lasted!</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>road bike Thift Case on Christmas Eve</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I'm writing the following just warn all QL readers to be careful with their belongings; especially NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING of value outside your homes on the porch or in your backyards or inside the cars. My road bike was stolen on 24th of December 2011; from right outside my house garage in the early morning hours. The Bike was parked and locked outside our house garage. So I never believed that it will be robbed in Qatar; because we live in a compound with security grads controlled gates and everything. .. However it happened. And From my observations and the way that the scum carried out their robbery; I&#8217;m pretty much convinced that; whoever stole the bike; they must have been watching and surveilling the house and the bike for a while; and must have had someone from inside the compound ( probably the grads) helping covering up for them while they carried out the robbery. Don't let this happen to you too. In the unfortunate case that it does happen to you; and if the garage was not broken in; go to Capital Police immediately. Does not touch anything in the garage or outside; they will take fingerprints from it?</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Dear Love; Yesterday; I was passing by your rectangular house in trigonometric lane. There I saw you with your cute circular face; conical nose and spherical eyes; standing in your triangular garden. Before seeing you; my heart was a null set; but when a vector of magnitude (likeness) from your eyes at a deviation of theta radians made a tangent to my heart; it differentiated. - - My love for you is a quadratic equation with real roots; which only you can solve by making good binary relation with me. The cosine of my love for you extends to infinity. I promise that I should not resolve you into partial functions but if I do so; you can integrate me by applying the limits from zero to infinity. You are as essential to me as an element to a set. The geometry of my life revolves around your acute personality. Yours ever loving; Pythagora ..</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Expats: Beware the Panhandlers</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>So yesterday I was with my family at Doha City. I decided to stay back in the car and read while my parents went inside to shop. An hour later; I heard someone tapping on the window. I looked up to see a man; of South Asian descent tapping on my window. 'Salam Aleikum;' he said when I looked up. I lowered the window and asked him what he wanted. Realizing I was Indian; he started speaking in Urdu and narrated a extremely pitiful story of how his hand was fractured and he had no money to treat it. He asked me for some cash. I told him I hadn't any after which he began begging again and said he wanted to go back to his home country. I didn't see the relation between his swollen hand and his desire to go back to his home; but the sight of the hand was disturbing. I relented and gave him five riyals. He looked at it and walked away without a word of Thanks. He then intercepted two Caucasian women walking to their car right behind mine. I lowered the window and watched. He narrated the same story. They listened; ignored him and drove away. A few minutes later; my Father stepped out of the store. I told him about the incident. He immediately understood and told me I should not have paid him. He told me about an incident near the Family Food Center at Bombay Chowpatty where he met someone similar who showed him a 'plastic bag that ran to his kidney' and begged him for money. Out of pity; when my dad gave him QR 50 he said it was 'not enough'. A waiter at Bombay Chowpatty then warned him against that there was a gang of panhandlers; most of whom are from the Indian subcontinent; who fake medical conditions to solicit money primarily from expats. I then spied him and pointed him out at which point he began to run away. Please do not indulge these people's requests if you encounter them. The Qatari police are supposedly on the lookout. They seem to congregate at expat heavy areas in Doha.</RelQBody>

My visa in-fact from a rich family and I'm from a poor background; she is very adamant and arrogant in attitude and her father playing with the money and threatening my parents in India as well. For the last two days they aren't allowing me to go for work; they took my mobile; wallet and threatening me for withdrawal of the case In India; Also; if I go to the Qatar police; they are threatening by the Qatar rules that the local rule always support the ladies and punish men... Please; what should I do to send them back to India? My 9 months old kid also suffering along with them....I have already messaged Indian Embassy ; sent messages to MOI; and I'm messaging this from the browsing center nearby. Here is my office Qatar Electro Mechanical Group; Almana; P:O:BOX 6013. Mobile number :33126120....at present my mobile is in their custody. Vimal Mohammed</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Your comments on my Job Offer</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Ok ok - I know this is the same question that everyone asks... but hey - thats why we have this forum so I can take help of people already in Qatar :-) So here's the deal: The employer is one of the well known business groups in Qatar - the 'J' Group. They are a trading company dealing in cars; petrochemicals; IT; heavy equipment etc. I do not need to sign a fixed term contract and in case I chose to quit the job; I give 30 days notice. I have approx. 5 years of total working experience and 1.5 yrs of Auditing experience. Position - Internal Auditor Basic - 7000 Housing - 3250 Phone - 300 Car - 1250 Petrol - 300 45 days leave per year in which 15 days is full salary and 30 days half salary. The company provides air tickets one time passage to home country. The other things sound pretty standard to what I have read on Qatar Living on offers received by others. I am bachelor and my current life style is: 1 bedroom furnished house (full kitchen; PC; internet; Living room) Once a week socialising at a pub/restaurant/house party/movie/sports activity. Annual Gym membership Car Annual holiday I would appreciate your comments in helping me figure out if I would be able to continue my current lifestyle and be able to save about QR 3;500 per month. My vision is to move to Doha for roughly 18-24 months. Cheers Nik</RelQBody>

But why they sent PMs in response to something you post in the main. Especially few females; who are super active in PMs and create problems for others and hide under PMs and they act like ANGELS. But they forget the fact that those men they interact on PMs are no saints!! It&#8217;s good for you if you could stay away from all the devils that are active on main and play PM &#8211; PM&#8230;..without bothering others!

			<RelQSubject>please ! make me women ....</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>A man was sick and tired of goingto work every day while his wife stayed home. He wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed: "Dear Lord: I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home. I want her to know what I go through; so please allow her body to switch with mine for a day. Amen. God; in his infinite wisdom; granted the man'swish. The next morning; sure enough; the man awoke as a woman. He arose; cooked breakfast forhis mate; awakened the kids; Set out their school clothes; fed them breakfast; packed their lunches; Drove them to school; came home andpicked up the dry cleaning; took it to the cleaners And stopped at the bank to make a deposit; went grocery shopping; Then drove home to put away the groceries; Paid the bills and balanced the checkbook. He cleaned the cat's litter box andbathed the dog. Then it was already 1 P.M.and he hurried to make the beds;do the laundry; vacuum; dust; and sweep and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework; Then set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing. At 4:30 he began peelingpotatoes and washing vegetables for salad; breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper. After supper; he cleaned the kitchen; ran the dishwasher; folded laundry; bathed the kids; and put them to bed. At 9 P.M. he was exhausted and; though his daily chores weren'tfinished; he went to bed where he was expected to make love; which he managed to get through without complaint. The next morning; he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said; Lord; I don't know what I was thinking. Iwas so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please; oh please; let us trade back." The Lord; in his infinite wisdom; replied; "My son; I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. You'll just have to wait nine months;though. You got pregnant last night."</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Single mother with a two year old daughter</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi there; Just wondering how hard it is for a single mother to sponsor her child over in Doha. Are there any single mothers out there that have done this or any that have been rejected? My acceptance of a position there will depend largely on whether I will be able to sponsor my daughter. My base salary will be QR21000/mth + allowances Thanks and any information would be much appreciated!!</RelQBody>

She kept berating people and fishing for me to TALK about them. I would not. I only repeated positive things. A strange situation. She looked for me on Facebook and then later unfriended me. It was very weird. Of course I had decided to unfriend her before this thought even crossed her mind. Moral of this incident. (You are the company you keep)</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Taking back gifts after a breakup!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I've heard of giving back the ring; but a man threatens to repossess ex's implants. Would you do the same - or take back gifts you may have given after a breakup ? A German man is demanding his ex-girlfriend pays him back the money he spent on buying her breast implants. The man; named by his first name Carsten in Bild newspaper; paid for his then girlfriend's breast augmentation procedure in 2009. His ex; Anastasia; says she now fears her breasts will be repossessed unless she refunds him the &#163;3;700 cost of the operation. Anastasia admitted that she signed a written agreement with Carsten saying that she would stay with him for at least a year if he paid for the implants. But they broke up soon after Anastasia had the breast augmentation and Carsten now wants his money back. Anastasia; 20; told reporters she had already transferred the equivalent of &#163;2;500 into his bank account. She was worried that Carsten would call the police and get repossesors involved if she failed to pay up. Ananova</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>qatar is ending sponsor system</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Qatari Premier and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani (C) at a recent meeting in Libya. Photograph: AFP DOHA - Qatar is considering ending the oft-criticised sponsorship system; under which employers sponsor foreign workers and have a great deal of control over them; the prime minister said on Thursday. "Changes have been made to the sponsorship system in Qatar;" and the council of ministers is "seriously studying" abolishing the system; Sheikh Hamad told reporters. "We are studying the issue very carefully to preserve the rights of citizens and foreign workers;" he added. Sponsorship systems for foreign workers exist in most Gulf countries; which employ millions of foreigners; especially from Asia. The system has been strongly criticised by rights groups and likened to modern-day slavery. In some cases; employers hold workers' passports and can deny them permission to change jobs. Bahrain abolished the system in 2009; and Kuwait reportedly plans to do so by February. Sheikh Hamad also said on Thursday that Qatar was not yet ready to hold its first partial parliamentary elections; which have been promised for several years. "The legislative elections will be held one day... We have fallen behind in completing various laws; of which three quarters have been adopted;" he said. The principle of a partly elected parliament was enshrined in the Gulf state's constitution which came into force in 2005. Two-thirds of the 45 members of the Majlis al-Shura (consultative assembly) would be selected by universal suffrage; with the other 15 appointed by the emir; according to an electoral law adopted in 2008.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Tipping Waiting Staff</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Go to Bombay Chowpatty any day of the week (the one besides Family Food Centre on the airport road); anytime after 1830 hrs. and you will see cars parked on both sides of the road. Not only; do a lot of them order their snacks etc. from the comforts of their vehicle; they also expect the waiter to clear their tray/ plates etc. after they're done eating. I have watched this over a period of time and even checked with one of the waiting staff; when it come to paying up; unfortunately; majority of them don't tip the waiters and that is disturbing. Tipping is totally voluntary; there is no requirement to tip a waiter. Yet; assuming the service provided by the waiter is acceptable; especially in this heat and humidity; the least you can do is appreciate the guy coming to you car every so often and leave a decent tip. I do not want to talk about restaurants where you have your formal sit-down dinners; because some of the tips there go to the management and not the waiting staff. Some of the guys tending to you from smaller restaurants and grocery stores; IMHO; do deserve a gratuity in the form of a tip... :-)</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Driving</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I am new on QL and have noticed that its quite popular among residents of Qatar. I would like to remind people to please drive carefully on the roads and follow traffic rules. Its really shocking to see that people have no respect for fellow drivers; even for cars with babies/ children in them! I was almost hit this morning by a reckless driver driving on 80kmph on a small road in residential area; who did not look at the STOP sign stuck on his side of the road and just drove zipping past me. I drive with my baby (5 months old) in his car-seat; so I don't drive in a high speed and stick to the speed limit allowed for roads; which is why he missed hitting me. Had I been in the same speed as him; he would have hit my car really hard. I expect people to respect the 'Baby on board' sign that is stuck on cars. I was so angry with this driver and would have followed his car to slap him really hard; had my baby not been with me in the car. I just wanted to vent out my anger thats why I'm posting it here and I'm sure there are many of you that have experienced this situation before. Please drive safely.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>GCC Resident Visit to UAE on FlyDubai</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi All; Hoping someone on here has had a similar experience to me and can offer some advice. I am an Engineer; with an Indian PP and have been in Qatar for about four months. I got my RP about a month ago. I have an upcoming weekend trip to Dubai; and was hoping to use the "Visa on Arrival for GCC Residents" route. FlyDubai just told me that I need to have been resident for at least 6 months to qualify for that. I tried calling the UAE Embassy in Doha; but could not get hold of anyone to ask my question. I normally wouldn't qualify for a Visa on Arrival on account of the Indian PP; however I thought the GCC residency allows exactly that. I have never heard of the minimum six months residence requirement; nor is that on any website online. Any thoughts?</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Small Story...BIG MORAL...!!!..</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Once a boy went to a shop with his mother. The shop keeper looked at the small cute child and showed him a bottle with sweets and said 'Dear Child..u can take the sweets... but the child didnt take. The shop keeper was surprised.. such a small child he is and why is he not taking the sweets from the bottle. Again he said take the sweets.... now mother also heard that and said.. son take the sweets.. yet he didnt take... The shopkeeper seeing the child not taking the sweets... he himself took the sweets and gave to the child...... the child was happy to get two hands full of sweets .... When returned to home Mother asked child... Why didnt you take the sweets... when shop keeper told you to take... Can you guess the response:- Child replies... Mom! my hands are very small and if i take the sweets I can only take few.. but now you see when uncle gave with his big hands.... how many more sweets i got! Moral: When we take we may get little but when God gives... HE gives us more beyond our expectations.... more than what we can hold....</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Wonders of working in Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Wonder No. 1; "It is all about geography" Regardless of your education; qualifications; experience etc; the biggest determinate of your salary and professional status will be the place you came from; if you are from an Anglo speaking western country you guarantee a place at the top of the corporate ladder with all its benefits; while if you are from some where in Asia or Africa; then the bottom is your place; even if you are doing a much better job. Wonder No. 2; "It is all about connections (wasta)" Got all the right credentials; relevant experience; proper educational etc; but you don't know the right people; then you are in the wrong place and you better forget about getting that deserved position. The Arabs invented the word "wasta" for that very common practice. Wonder No. 3 "The more you work; the less you get" People who work in the "best" places such as governmental or semi governmental organizations work the least (by quantitative and qualitative measures) and earn the most; on the other side of the slide the unfortunate ones working in the "worst" private organizations; work very hardly and for endless hours and their earnings will barely make ends meet. Wonder No. 4 "The more you stay; the less you get" Yes it is true that as the years go by you are getting more experienced both in your profession and in the local market; but don't be surprised if that far less experienced new colleague who just arrived to Doha yesterday get double your salary. After all; the sponsorship laws will guarantee that you are stuck in your work forever; while your new colleague have the freedom of choice; at least till he arrives to Qatar. Wonder No. 5 "Labor law" No body seems to apply; understand; or even care about the labor law; again the "best" places such as governmental or semi governmental organizations create working conditions that can easily be envied by workers in Western Europe; while on the other side many of the private organizations apply their own custom made slavery laws we thought abolished in the 19th century. Wonder No. 6; "No body seems to wonder or do anything about all the above wonders!" wonder no. 7; still we all are living here...its a wonder indeed.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Check your RP/Visa before you travel</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hey; a strange experience folks. When ever you are travelling please check if your RP / Visa is valid at least for a period of 6 months. My RP expires on 16 Nov.2010; while the Immigration counter cleared with their seal; the guy Pravesh of Qatar Airways in the departure lounge never permitted me to board the flight at the last minute. I showed my return flight is within 48 hours; even if he wants me have a longer vacation;I cannot stay away; as I joined my employer 8 months back. I showed my EXIT permit and I am travelling to Muscat just for 2 days for a family commitment. As per GCC regulations the Visa is stamped for 2 years and RP renewed every year; I don't know how the Visa was also stamped for one year in my case. He took me to his Supervisor another Kid of 24; 25 years ; I mentioned I have lived in the GCC for 24 years and I would not jeopardise my job nor their job; but the guy went on blabbering 'I don't want to lose my job' again and again. I pity the plight of these youngsters; who would not understand practicality - while my stay in the airport for 2 hours such chaos and passengers speaking high tone and getting away for excess baggage and what not; I politely asked me to show me the counter for processing the refund and walked home with disappointment; afterall a week end trip to Muscat and back was futile. Please check the RP well before you plan your trip; just a caution so that you do not face the same disappointment; specially if it is a annual vacation. L.Balakrishnan</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Stenden University (CHN) TRUE REVIEW</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I am writing this forum because I seek to know where; and what is the procedure to complain against the above stated university (if you can call it that). Don&#8217;t get me wrong I am not one of those loud mouths who actually do nothing but think that it&#8217;s everybody else&#8217;s fault when they fail. What I am about to provide are all logical facts; and for those with concern I have a GPA of 3.5 (hence don&#8217;t assume this as a random rant). It has been a year since I have been in this university and these are things that I have witnessed; and believe when I am paying 16;000QR for tuition I honestly believe I got more knowledge while wiping my bum on the toilet. So here is a list of FACTS that should make the ministry take notice and shut this building down IMMEDIATLY: - There are no computers in the library (yes there are available elsewhere; thank god!!) - There is no plan on paper on what the students have to achieve in order to graduate; it is made up as time passes....if you don&#8217;t believe me feel free to walk up to the institute and ask for it - The &#8220;cafeteria&#8221; or accurately know as the entrance has not has one stable company in the previous god knows how many years. - THE SECURITY CAMERA&#8217;S ARE WEBCAMS - I would assume a &#8220;university&#8221; would provide its students with some sporting activities; a gym would be nice. - Don&#8217;t advertise the castle as a part of the university; there are only certain language classes there; 90% of the students suffer in the hell hole building - The monitors of the computers were recently replaced (but not the CPU itself); I assuming to trick the students into believing they were new computers. - For the first 2 years the examinations are PURELY true/false or multiple choice questions. I will not disclose the incident that have gotten me stark raving mad; but any one with half a brain in the university should be able to figure out my identity; I guess I shall remain anonymous. I am currently attending the university and upon graduating I urge students who feel the same as me to join and actually take action against this monstrosity. Please any individual who feels they have the needs to take action against them PM; I am willing to do whatever it takes</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Winter agony for KG kids</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Please find below a letter to Gulf Times Editor written br Mr. Abdul Nasar A. K. and published in today's GT For your comments. _________________________________________________________ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Winter agony for KG kids Dear Sir; It is heart-rending for parents to awake their KG-going children early in the morning; around 5 o&#8217;clock; for school every day in winter. Every morning I feel extremely guilty when I force my four-year-old daughter to get up at that time so that she can go to school. If our children are genuinely conscious of their rights they would file a lawsuit against their parents to protect them from this type of &#8220;abuse&#8221;! It is a type of torture and cruelty even though our actions are inspired by good intentions and the future well-being of our kids itself. But good intentions cannot always justify actions. Nevertheless; my suggestion to expatriate school managements is to consider changing timing for KG pupils from January to March at least. Classes for the above category now start at the same time as for senior grades and end by 11am. Special buses then take the kids back home. It will not be an additional burden for school managements if they deploy these buses to collect KG students from their houses by 9am and start their classes by 10am. KG classes could end by 1pm as with senior pupils and they can all return home in one bus. I would like to request all parents to come forward with their suggestions. School authorities also can make a survey to know how parents think about this suggestion; if they see it worth considering. Abdul Nasar A K aknaser@yahoo.co.uk</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>My husband brought me and my 2 yr old son almost 6 mos ago through Family visit visa. He was supposed to work out our Resident Visa but unfortunately law changed and salary req't became Qr10000. And right now he has about Qr8000. So we didn't have a choice but to stay 6mos maximum (we're leaving next week). After 3 mos i will be coming back (Inshallah) so i can work (visit visa again) and hopefully we can get our son by combined salary.It will really be a big sacrifice leaving my son..but not for long though. Hopefully things will work out next time and we can be a happy family again. I will miss Doha though.. 'tis been a home for almost 6 mos.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>True Happiness</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>This story is about a beautiful; expensively dressed lady who complained to her psychiatrist that she felt that her whole life was empty; it had no meaning. So; the lady went to visit a counselor to seek out happiness. The counselor called over the old lady who cleaned the office floors. The counselor then said to the rich lady"I'm going to ask Mary here to tell you how she found happiness. All I want you to do is listen to her." So the old lady put down her broom and sat on a chair and told her story: "Well; my husband died of malaria and three months later my only son was killed by a car. I had nobody... I had nothing left. I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat;I never smiled at anyone; I even thought of taking my own life. Then one evening a little kitten followed me home from work. Somehow I felt sorry for that kitten. It was cold outside; so I decided to let the kitten in. I got it some milk; and the kitten licked the plate clean. Then it purred and rubbed against my leg and for the first time in months; I smiled. Then I stopped to think; if helping a little kitten could make me smile; maybe doing something for people could make me happy. So the next day I baked some biscuits and took them to a neighbor who was sick in bed. Every day I tried to do something nice for someone. It made me so happy to see them happy. Today; I don't know of anybody who sleeps and eats better than I do. I've found happiness; by giving it to others." When she heard that the rich lady cried. She had everything that money could buy; but she had lost the things which money cannot buy.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Palin's town charged rape victims for exams!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>The Alaskan town where Sarah Palin once served as mayor charged alleged rape victims for forensic examinations; it has emerged. Wasilla was one of a handful of places in the state that billed members of the public or their insurance companies for test kits costing up to &#163;600. Charlie Fannon; the police chief hired by the first female Republican vice-presidential nominee; complained about burdening taxpayers with the cost when the practice was banned in 2000 by the state legislature. "It was one of those things everyone could agree on except Wasilla;" Eric Croft; the Democrat who sponsored the legislation; told CNN. "We couldn't convince the chief of police to stop charging them." A spokesman for her campaign denied that Mrs Palin; a mother of five; knew about the practice and said she was against it in principle. But Mr Croft said he believed that Mrs Palin; who was elected Alaska's governor in 2006; was not ignorant of the issue; given that it was under public discussion for six months prior to the bill being passed. Critics have said her failure to stop the practices while she was mayor from 1996 to 2002 undermined Mrs Palin's claims that she has worked to reduce sexual assaults. Alaska routinely has the highest rate of sexual assault in the United States; two and a half times the national average. After the law passed; Mr Fannon told the Frontiersman newspaper: "In the past; we've charged the cost of the exams to the victim's insurance company when possible. I just don't want to see any more burden on the taxpayer."</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Dances With Wolves</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Tonight I stayed up to watch a movie although I have work early in the morning tomorrow and although I am watvhing it for the 4th time. Its called dances with the wolves. I am sure many of you in this blog have watched this movie and it has captured your hearts for its beautiful sceneries and heart warming moments looking at two different set of people and cultures&#194;&#160; learning from one another. I am very fond of this movie as it dwells in a subject which is of interest to me. It is called the art of diplomacy. This movie is a testament to what many of us in this world lack and a point many countires today repeatedly miss. Its the simple step of how patience / tolerance and the willingness to understand the other brings people from two different backgrounds (no matter how horrible their past was) together towards a lasting relationship. Kevin costner who played the role of the soldier at the border post who is always trying to understand the indians and the indian (who is called "kicking bird") was always patient and tolerant no matter what the other indians said. If only the world could learn such simple lessonS and take such simple steps..... Then the world would be one beautiful place to live in.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Dutch Muslims have offered to guard three Coptic churches in the Netherlands which have been threatened on an Al Qaeda-linked website after a New Year&#8217;s Day bombing attack killed 21 Coptic Christians in Egypt. The Dutch Muslim Council; the Council of Moroccan Mosques in the Netherlands and the Federation of Islamic Organisations &#8220;offer protection&#8221; to three Dutch Coptic churches which were among 50 in Egypt and Europe threatened on a list on an Al Qaeda-linked website; they said in a statement. The Dutch Islamic groups promised to ensure that &#8220;Muslims are ready to guard the three churches; in Amsterdam; Utrecht and Eindhoven; against the threat by Al Qaeda&#8221;. Gulf-Times 5/1/11 My comment: I think that this is a great idea. Specially after someone said: Not all Muslims are terrorists but most terrorists are Muslims. I hope to see this spirit of protecting one another from those vile terrorists; spread across the world; specially West Europe and USA. No man is an island. We all need one another irrespective of creed; religion; skin colour BUT we surely don't need terrorists.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>office jokes</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>How to Maintain a Healthy Level of Insanity in the Workplace 1) Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice. 2) Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits. Wear them one day after you boss does. This is especially effective if your boss is a different gender. 3) Make up nicknames for all your coworkers and refer to them only by these names. "That's a good point; Sparky." "No; I'm sorry; but I'm going to have to disagree with you there; Cha-cha." 4) Send e-mail to the rest of the company telling them exactly what you're doing. For example: "If anyone needs me; I'll be in the bathroom." 5) Hi-Lite your shoes. Tell people you haven't lost them as much since you did this. 6) Hang mosquito netting around your cubicle. When you emerge to get coffee or a printout or whatever; slap yourself randomly the whole way. 7) Put a chair facing a printer. Sit there all day and tell people you're waiting for your document. 8) Every time someone asks you to do something; anything; ask them if they want fries with that. 9) Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair-dancing. 10) Put your trash can on your desk. Label it "IN." 11) Feign an unnatural and hysterical fear of staplers. 12) Send e-mail messages saying there's free pizza or donuts or cake in the lunch room. When people drift back to work complaining that they found none; lean back; pat your stomach and say; "Oh you've got to be faster than that." 13) Put decaf in the coffee maker for three weeks. Once everyone has withdrawn from caffeine addiction; switch to espresso.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Qatar is my new home - Please don't talk bad about it</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I see a lot of topics here on QL from time to time.It makes an interesting read from time to time but some of the comments which have a very negative shade give me a bad headache at times.Below are my points on this: 1.Qatar is my new home so it is for most of you. 2. Before coming here I did a small exercise to make up my mind about what to expect and what not to expect. I think all of us should do that so that we are not surprised. 3.Comparison of Qatar with your hometown is not justified.It's a newly developed country. 4. This is the place where we all have come due to our own personal interests and hence we are not in a position to complain too much. 5.We should all try and do soething about things that we feel are wrong and try and improve it instead of just being a pessimist. 6.Writing disparaging things about the country on QL can get you into trouble if you cross the lines of decency.You never know who is reading your post and if that person happends to be of someone of authority;you might have to repent. I'am not saying that I'am perfect and hence I'am trying to preach you.These are just a few points that came to my mind and I thought of sharing them with you.It's up to you.Take it or Leave it.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>FAMILY VISA APPROVED BUT with RP PROBLEM</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello to all the people here in Qatarliving!..May I ask if someone could give us the best suggestion regarding our problem with my family visa? Our problem is; my husband is currently working here in a government sector and on "Definite Contract" for 2 years with a bachelor status in the company;in short; he is not entitled to get family visa for me unless the contract will not yet renewed and change to family.Because of his eagerness to get a family visa for me; i came here for a family visit and applied for family visa in the immigration andwe are very happy that it was already approved and I had my medical and finger printing..When we went to immigration to apply for an RP the lady told us to go the captain to have my form signed if we are going to shoulder the payment for the visa;unfortunately the captain didn't sign my application form but rather asked for a letter from the company..We are very worried because we understand that the company will not give us a letter to the immigration because my husband is not yet entitled of the family status.. Please give us some advise on what we are going to do; the lady on the counter told me that it is possible to get an RP without the letter but it is the decession of the captain...</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Please help stop infanticide !</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>How can we allow this to go on ? Help stop it NOW! Millions of male chicks are killed every year by the egg industry; according to new undercover footage from animal campaigners; that shows the tiny birds on a "conveyor belt to death". The birds are dropped onto a conveyor belt where they are sorted by sex. The males are apparently either thrown alive into electronic mincers or instantly gassed to death. The females are kept for laying; but only after they have been placed in a machine that clips off the end of their beaks and jabs them against disease. Viva! visited two hatcheries in Preston. At Tom Barron hatchery they claimed the male chicks were gassed in a giant machine and their bodies packaged to be fed to reptiles. At Fresh Farm Hatchery they claim the birds are thrown directly into a mincer and used for fertiliser. The birds are sorted for sex according to colour. In the gassing method whole crates of males are put in a chamber and then packaged once they are dead. The mincing or &#8216;instantaneous mechanical destruction&#8217; is usually a quicker route to death and is widely used in the US. Both methods are legal and approved by both the Humane Slaughter Association and the RSPCA. Source: Telegraph</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Woman apparent suicide over affair</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Sharjah: A 26-year-old woman reportedly committed suicide after leaving an &#8216;I love you' message in her own blood scrawled on the wall; Gulf News has learnt. According to police; the woman; from India; committed suicide on Sunday in an apartment where she was living with her family in the Al Khan area. The woman was apparently dejected after her family told her that she could not marry the man of her choice; a senior Sharjah Police official said. The official said the woman was reportedly in love with a man but her family had refused to accept him or approve of their marriage plans. "She always had heated arguments and disputes with her family in order to get their approval;" the official said. Article continues below Investigation The woman was found with deep gashes on her forearms and &#8216;I love you' scrawled on the wall of her room in her own blood next to the name of her boyfriend; said the official. The victim had also reportedly tied one end of a sari around her neck and the other end to the ceiling fan in her room. The family is believed to have called in the police after making the horrific discovery. A police ambulance transferred the woman's body to Al Kuwaiti Hospital around 2.30am and then transferred it to the forensic laboratory; the official said. The police have launched an investigation into the case. The victim's family is waiting for the body to be handed over to them; said the official.</RelQBody>

Any of you guys faced same issue? Because i dont want service man to play with the car; as already a local garage guy put some grease somewhere he thought the sound is coming; but to no avail. Last resort is Honda service; though i know they will also play with many parts before reaching to source of noise. I put this in forums instead of question; as i know ppl would suggest the source of noise. Thanks in advance</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Think before changing your BB to iphone4</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I supossed to sell my Blackberry and change to iphone 4.Because i was amazed on that phone; Luckily i did not; what i did is i asked vodaphone first and qtel for their mobile internet. For Blackberry i am paying for 125 riyals for blackberry services wich includes unlimited Yahoo messenger that you can open for 24/7. BB email;FB;Twitter and unlimited surf For Iphone 4 you need to have a internet plan for at least 250GB to run your iphone and enjoy it. Qtel 250gb= 50 qar/month 1gb = 100 qar/month 2gb= 200 qar/month but if you exceeds on it you need to pay for 1riyal per 10MB. Unlimited is 400 riyals Do you know how many Megabytes it takes to surf the Mobile Internet? Ifyou like to browse sites like BBC or CNN; the average page is about0.10 MB. That means that if you look at 10 to 15 webpages; you&#8217;ll useabout 1 MB. Sites like Google&#8482; are about 0.05 MB per page; so youcan look at around 20 to 25 search results pages and use approximately1 MB. If you use the Facebook&#8482; mobile site; it&#8217;s optimized forviewing on your handset so those pages are only about 0.025 MB each.That means you can look at 40 pages and only use 1 MB! So in short BB is much cheaper for internet users coz you can open your yahoo messenger for unlimited not like in Iphone4. Qtel and vodaphone has a capped on their internet mobiles. In my home country you just need to pay for 100 riyals and you will have unlimited internet mobile with out worrying if you will exceed your gig limit. I hope i gave you an advice before getting an iphone</RelQBody>

She is Tunisian and unfortunately she is also the Manager... so my complaints never reached the owner (the manager just hangs up the phone whenever I call to discuss the matter). I asked her for subtle highlights for my wedding and she did the worst highlights ever. They started over an inch from my scalp; so I looked like I had regrowth before even stepping out of the salon! She gave me bright bleached stripes... not at all the subtle blended highlights that I asked for. Further; she spent the entire time gossiping about the other members of staff; which was not pleasant to hear - totally unprofessional. She is an absolute shocker and I do not recommend any one go there. I used to go there a lot; but having dealt with that impossible woman; I just can't stomach spending any money to assist in making the business successful. I do not recommend going there... Buyer Beware!!</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Family Visa and Idea on salary</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Dear All; I am from India and i have masters from the Top Uni in UK. I have been offered a traffic engineer role at Parsons. The package that is offered is very low. It is 8K; plus there won't be any sponsorship for my family. I am very upset about the offer but the role is in my field and is good for my career. The problem is i feel i am being undervalued here because of the Poor European condition. I want to know; would i be able to sponsor my family (in near future) with this salary. (basic 5200+living allowance 2800). I also want to know; if i could change the company after a certain period of time as i feel the salary in very low but i need the job so i am thinking abt accepting it. I believe seasoned people in this forum might provide a helpful guide to me.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Dictator. They got that right</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>As Ahmed-Dinner-Jacket leaves the Presidency the one thing Iranians know is that he had a position without power. The real power lies with the 12 members of the Religious Council and their leader. They know a dictator when they see one. ---------------- Iran dissident's funeral turns into anti-government protest Tens of thousands have attended the funeral of a senior dissident cleric; in what became Iran's biggest anti-government protest for years. Ayatollah Jalaluddin Taheri died at the age of 87 on Sunday in Isfahan. He was a vocal opponent of the hardliners in power in Iran and had resigned from his post in protest. Mourners at the funeral chanted slogans against the government and Iran's supreme leader; Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; describing him as a dictator. Protesters also called for the release of all political prisoners; including the two top leaders of the reformist green movement who are under house arrest in Tehran. Ayatollah Taheri was a pro-reformist Friday prayer leader in Isfahan; one of the largest cities in Iran. It is the biggest such protest in Iran in the past few years; and interestingly the police did not intervene; says Kasra Naji of BBC Persian. The authorities are careful not to provoke public anger just 10 days ahead of the presidential elections; observers say.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Denying Exit Permit</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hi everyone! My girlfriend is working in Doha; so she got a residence permit and she's under a working visa. What happened is that she found out some sort of vascular disease which is ruining her legs (and she works at a restaurant). She needs to make an operation as soon as possible!! But she has been working there for 3 or 4 months now and the company says that they cannot do anything for her because she MUST complete at least 7 months working. This operation is expensive in Qatar and if the company doesn't help to pay she cannot do it. So the solution is to quit the job and come back to Turkey. BUUUT for my surprise she said it is impossible because they wouldn't give her the EXIT PERMIT... It sounds extremely absurd and nonsense since it's a health issue and it seems that she is locked in the country and in a job she can no longer do it. Sorry for the long text but I hope you guys can gimme some advices!</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Just to say hello!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello QL Memebers; I am neither new to Qatar nor new to QL. I have been living in Doha for over 10 years and been using QL as my 'search tool' for anything and everything about Doha :-) Just gathered that I have been a member for over a year; but never been active and hence thought of changing my status from inactive member to an active member. So; here is a big HELLO to all you guys out there.. hoping to meet some of you in the QL group activities. Happy QL-ing all of you! :-) Here's a thought for the day: "Whenever I am tempted to want more material comfort or sense gratification; even though I know in my heart I have enough to get by; then I just think to myself - 'Whatever I have; it is sufficient; this is what's given; it's how much I get. Just this much is my exactly appropriate and perfectly lawful karmic ration; and I remain thankful for it'. This is a good practice for cultivating gratitude; satisfaction and contentment - ultimate form of wealth!" - Words of Lama Surya Das (Jeffrey Miller) in his book THE BIG QUESTIONS.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Fathers entitled to breastfeeding leave</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Is the world going crazy or I am not up with the times ? Europe's top court has declared that working fathers in Spain are entitled to take 'breastfeeding leave' everyday; even if the mother of the child is not employed. The Court ruled that the law caused an 'unjustified discrimination on grounds of sex' because fathers do not have the same rights as mothers The new legislation means that both the mother and father are allowed to leave work for an hour during the day or reduce their working day by half an hour during the first nine months following the birth of a child. The European Union Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled on Thursday that the Spanish law caused an "unjustified discrimination on grounds of sex" because fathers do not have the same rights as mothers. Breastfeeding leave should now be considered as "time purely devoted to the child" in order to reconcile family life and work after maternity leave. Source: Telegraph</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Hi Guys; Good day. I'm under my husband's sponsorship til today but his contract will be ending this April 30. Good thing he's been hired with another company. Sadly; the company will not give release but only NOC so that means we need to go back to our country (cancelled). Plan is;he will come after a week or two after exiting then coming back with a visit visa with the new company. My question is; how fast can my husband gets his New RP and sponsor me and my daughter. Some told us that we need to present again 6 months bank statements. (All our accounts are expected to be closed before exiting). Problem is i have a new offer already but they can't wait that long till i can come back. Your thoughts on this please.</RelQBody>

But this one is being so very secretive about it sometimes! I can't even tell they pooped!!! So how many times do cats usually go poop a day? Cheers;</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Hi all; the question below is only for Australian citizens or Australian permanent residents currently living in Qatar. Last week; I was blessed me with a baby boy. I am an Australian citizen. I have applied for baby's birth certificate at Hamad Hospital (although the baby was born at Al Ahli Hospital). After getting the birth certificate; I intend to apply for baby's Australian passport and Qatari Family Visa soon after that. Is there any Australian citizen on QL who has gone through the same process as me? If yes; please give me some tips of doing this process in the quickest and most convenient way.

			<RelQSubject>Venezuela expels Israeli ambassador over Gaza</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Caracas: Venezuela ordered Israel's ambassador expelled from the country on Tuesday in protest over the Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip. The decision by President Hugo Chavez to kick out the diplomat appeared to be the strongest reaction yet to the Gaza offensive by any country with ties to Israel. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry announced the move in a statement; saying it "has decided to expel the Israeli ambassador and part of the Israeli Embassy's personnel." The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed nearly 600 Palestinians in ground and air strikes. Israel launched the attacks Dec. 27 to stop Palestinian militants from firing rockets into southern Israel. "How far will this barbarism go?" Chavez asked on state television before the ambassador's expulsion was announced. "The president of Israel should be taken before an international court together with the president of the United States; if the world had any conscience." Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said its U.N. mission is joining with other countries in demanding the Security Council "apply urgent and necessary measures to stop this invasion." Israeli diplomats could not immediately be reached for comment. The embassy in Caracas was closed; and it was unclear how the Israeli government would respond. Jewish community leader Abraham Levy; president of the Venezuelan Confederation of Israelite Associations; called the government's decision "taking the side of a terrorist group" by backing Gaza's Hamas leaders while ignoring Israel's perspective. "I deeply lament that decision made by the government; which cuts off an enormous and long tradition of friendship between the people of Israel and the people of Venezuela;" Levy told The Associated Press. He said the decision leaves Venezuela's Jewish community &#8212; which numbers nearly 15;000 &#8212; "not only worried but also deeply battered" because it "attempts to demonize the state of Israel." While many countries have protested Israel's offensive; none besides Venezuela so far have expelled the ambassador. Mauritania; which established relations with Israel in 1999; called home its ambassador from the Jewish state on Monday. Jordan and Egypt; the other two Arab nations with relations with Israel; summoned their Israeli ambassadors to protest the Gaza attacks; but they have resisted popular calls to expel them. Chavez has long been critical of the Israeli government's policies in the Middle East and has supported the Palestinians' stance in the conflict. During Israel's 2006 conflict in Lebanon; Chavez withdrew his top envoy from Israel; calling the bombings there "a new Holocaust." Relations have remained at a scaled-back level since. Chavez's condemnations of Israel's offensive in Gaza have grown gradually more severe in recent days. On Monday he called the Jewish state a "genocidal government;" and on Tuesday urged Jews in Venezuela to take a stand against the Israeli government. In spite of harsh criticisms of Israel; Chavez's government has insisted it is friendly toward Jewish people. Chavez met with Jewish leaders in August; pledging to work against anti-Semitism despite strong differences on Mideast politics. Top Venezuelan officials explained Tuesday's decision speaking to cheering supporters at a Caracas mosque. Some in the crowd chanted "Gaza; hold on. The people are rising up!" Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said Venezuela declared the Israeli ambassador "persona non grata" and decided to "reduce to a minimum the representation of this embassy in Venezuela." Justice Minister Tarek El Aissami; who is of Arab descent; said "our revolution is also a revolution for a free Palestine!" Chavez accuses Israel of acting on behalf of the United States in the Mideast; and he has forged close ties with Israel's top enemies &#8212; Iran and Syria. Chavez also has used the tool of expelling an ambassador before. Last September; he kicked out U.S. envoy Patrick Duddy saying it was in solidarity with Bolivia; which also booted its U.S. ambassador; accusing him of aiding violent protests. Demonstrations against the offensive have been held in various Latin American countries in recent days. In Argentina; which has the third-largest Jewish population outside Israel; hundreds of people marched to the Israeli Embassy to call for an end to the offensive. Brazil's government; like Venezuela; has said it is sending food and medical aid to the Gaza Strip. And in Bolivia; about a hundred Palestinians and Arabs marched to protest the violence.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>assistance with Loan</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I have been working in Qatar since August 2011 and have completed my 2 years contract with my employer. It is not just the workers in construction side but also management level professionals been treated like slaves. And the worst part is that we (Immigrants) can't take any action against the employers here. I was working with a local employer in the hospitality section as IT Manager. I was promised that I will get release/NOC after completing my two years contract with the company. I did completed my contract and found another opportunity with a high package and family benefits. I have two kids; one 11 months old and the other two and half year old; for me the important thing was to look for something that could help me to get the best health and living facilities for my kids; which was offered by the new company. I gave a notice period of 40 days to my company with a written request to get NOC to work in Qatar and my management confirmed in writing that I shall be getting my NOC. The time I completed my 40 days&#8217; notice with a proper handover; the company refused to give me NOC and thus I became jobless. Because I left the company and I cannot join another one; I have nothing to survive. I have bank liabilities taken for my family support; now the bank is asking me to clear the liabilities which I cannot because my ex. employer hasn&#8217;t paid my end of services and still holding my passport and I have no work even to feed my kids so how can I pay the bank. Bank is not allowing me to go out of the country because of the liabilities and my ex. company is not giving me release to work anywhere else in Qatar. If I couldn't pay the bank they can put me in jail that makes me worry because I don&#8217;t know what will happen to my kids. I tried to go the human rights commission here in Qatar but I was strictly informed not to file any complaint or case against the local employer as they will put me and my family in more troubles. I don&#8217;t know what to do. And I don&#8217;t know who I should ask to get help. I have been cheated badly by my ex employer and I can't do anything.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Qatar Multiple Permanent Work Visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>My older brother is an Engineer who has been selected to work for a Japanese Company in Qatar. After completing all the requirements on the 3rd week of March;2010; the Recruitment Agency in Manila submitted all the required documents to the Employer in Qatar for work visa processing. After two months of waiting; according to the Recruitment Agency; the Qatar Multiple Permanent Work Visa for my brother is still under process up to this time (20 May 2010). Hence; he was advised to wait a bit more because from the Agency's previous deployment to the same Employer; it took about 3 months to wait. This means that he needs to wait for yet another one month from now 1.e.(20 May 2010 up to 20 June 2010). Is the 3-month processing of the above-mentioned kind of visa normal in Qatar. Alternatively; is it advisable for him to look for other job opportunities and accept offers from other Employers; as certainty has not yet been fully guaranteed by the First Recruitment Agency. He seems to be losing hope and patience as well - to wait for his visa any further. Can some knowledgeable individuals here enlighten us on the above matter and please advise. Thank you very much in advance. Jerome Del M Q.C.; Philippines</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>I worked 9 months with a private co as a manager. I was asked to resign with a promise to give NOC with one month notice (as per contract 2 month notice if employee resigns). HR sent me email on the first day after submitting resignation confirming to provide NOC. On that assurance; I searched jobs here and when approached for NOC after getting job; they refused to give NOC. After more request asked to show offer letter; then submitted again request letter as they wanted. Still I am being troubled and waiting for NOC. Now; if finally they don't give NOC and cancel my visa; can I lodge complaint with CID or labout dept or with both as I have email proof of confirmation to give me NOC.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Can India take a stand for free speech</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>India should give political asylum to American whistleblower Edward Snowden for exposing the US cyber snooping programme that targeted India in a big way; WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said. Assange; who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 19 last year; said in an exclusive interview that India was among the first countries he had approached for asylum. But he never heard back. "I was disappointed and saddened that India; known for upholding human rights; never got back despite several requests by me for asylum. Indians are also great supporters of WikiLeaks. I therefore contacted the foreign office through the Indian high commissioner. I wrote to them but they never responded;" Assange said. The WikiLeaks founder said that if a small nation like Ecuador could have the guts to provide him asylum; India which has considerable global standing with a billion-plus population should not be afraid of "standing up for human rights" and giving Snowden asylum. "Ecuadorians showed immense courage and granted me asylum;" he added. Assange called Snowden a hero for exposing "the most serious events of the decade" &#8212; how America was snooping into people's emails; phone calls; messages en masse and across the globe. "It was because of Snowden that India came to know how US was snooping on them. It is an obligation for India to protect Snowden. Now is the time for India to show it stands up for human rights;" he said. Assange warned Snowden against serious witch-hunting by the US government. The Australian information activist; who is trying to avoid extradition to face "trumped up" charges of sexual offences in Sweden; said he is still willing to take asylum in India if such an offer comes. WikiLeaks has a big support base in India. But the government should show more courage;" Assange said.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>7% ...</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>7% Written by a 90 year old This is something we should all read at least once a week!!!!! Make sure you read to the end!!!!!! Written by Regina Brett; 90 years old; of the Plain Dealer; Cleveland ; Ohio . "To celebrate growing older; I once wrote the 45 lessons life taught me. It is the most requested column I've ever written. My odometer rolled over to 90 in August; so here is the column once more: 1. Life isn't fair; but it's still good. 2. When in doubt; just take the next small step. 3. Life is too short &#8211; enjoy it.. 4. Your job won't take care of you when you are sick. Your friends and family will. 5. Pay off your credit cards every month. 6. You don't have to win every argument. Stay true to yourself. 7. Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone. 8. It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it. 9. Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck. 10. When it comes to chocolate; resistance is futile. 11. Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present. 12. It's OK to let your children see you cry. 13. Don't compare your life to others. You have no idea what their journey is all about. 14. If a relationship has to be a secret; you shouldn't be in it.. 15. Everything can change in the blink of an eye But don't worry; God never blinks. 16. Take a deep breath. It calms the mind. 17. Get rid of anything that isn't useful. Clutter weighs you down in many ways. 18. Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger. 19. It's never too late to be happy. But it&#8217;s all up to you and no one else. 20. When it comes to going after what you love in life; don't take no for an answer. 21. Burn the candles; use the nice sheets; wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special. 22. Over prepare; then go with the flow. 23. Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple. 24. The most important sex organ is the brain. 25. No one is in charge of your happiness but you. 26. Frame every so-called disaster with these words 'In five years; will this matter?' 27. Always choose life. 28. Forgive but don&#8217;t forget. 29. What other people think of you is none of your business. 30. Time heals almost everything. Give time time. 31. However good or bad a situation is; it will change. 32. Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.. 33. Believe in miracles. 34. God loves you because of who God is; not because of anything you did or didn't do. 35. Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now. 36. Growing old beats the alternative -- dying young. 37. Your children get only one childhood. 38. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved. 39. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere. 40. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's; we'd grab ours back. 41. Envy is a waste of time. Accept what you already have not what you need. 42. The best is yet to come... 43. No matter how you feel; get up; dress up and show up. 44. Yield. 45. Life isn't tied with a bow; but it's still a gift." Its estimated 93% won't forward this. If you are one of the 7% who will; forward this with the title '7%'. I'm in the 7%. Friends are the family that we choose.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>FIFA member says 2022 World Cup should not be in Qatar</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>A member of FIFA's executive committee says awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a "blatant mistake'' and that even moving it to avoid searing summer temperatures wouldn't be ideal. Former German soccer federation president Theo Zwanziger tells SportBild that a suggestion by FIFA President Sepp Blatter to play the tournament in winter would seriously affect the European leagues and threaten the "unity of German football.'' Blatter plans to ask the committee to consider the switch - going back on his previous position of insisting on a summer tournament in a country where the temperature regularly exceeds 100 degrees. "If this World Cup is to become a party for the people; you can't play football in the summer;'' Blatter said. "You can cool down the stadiums but you can't cool down the whole country.'' Zwanziger said Blatter's U-turn showed that most of the executive committee had voted "against a fair awarding procedure'' in giving the World Cup to Qatar in 2010. The 68-year-old former tax inspector said that rather than rescheduling the tournament; it should be awarded to another country. "If the decision at the time was really wrong you have to cancel it and avoid burdens on those previously uninvolved;'' Zwanziger said. (AP)</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Tips for a healthy Ramadan</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. What to eat and what to avoid this Ramadan --------------------------------------------------------- Have a light meal: Do not stuff yourself with food and drinks during or between Iftar and Suhoor. This contradicts the spirit of Ramadan and defeats the whole object of fasting. Health problems can emerge as a result of excess food intake which can &#8216;clog&#8217; your digestive system. At Iftar it is advisable to have a very light meal first &#8212; like dates and juices or soup and reserve the main meal for later after the Maghrib prayers perhaps or even after Taraweeh (special night prayers). The body&#8217;s immediate need is to get water and an easily available energy source in the form of glucose for every living cell; particularly the brain. What to eat: Due to the long hours of fasting; we should consume slow digesting foods including fibre-containing foods (which last up to 8 hours) rather than fast-digesting foods (which last for only 3-4 hours). Slow digesting foods contain grains and seeds like barley; wheat; oats; millet; semolina; beans; lentils; whole meal flour; unpolished rice; etc (called complex carbohydrates). Fibre-containing foods are bran; whole wheat; grains and seeds; vegetables like green beans; peas; spinach; the leaves of beetroot (iron-rich); fruit with skin; dried fruit especially dried apricots; and prunes; almonds; etc. Foods to avoid: Anything hot; spicy; hot or salty. Too much salty food will make your body retain water and give you the feeling of being bloated; while spicy foods also induce thirst. Sweets and sugary foods are fast-burning and will only last for 3-4 hours. Moreover; these will turn into fat; increase cholesterol levels and make you gain weight. Fried foods are unhealthy and should be limited. They cause indigestion; heartburn and weight problems. -------------------------------------------------------- What to drink: Drink sufficient water between Iftar and bedtime to avoid dehydration. Drinks with high caffeine content (coffee; tea; chocolate; sodas and even decaffeinated teas and coffees) should be avoided. Caffeine leaches calcium from your system; which means you feel less full all the time. Avoid drinking tea at suhoor (dawn); as tea increases salt excretion in the urine; which is needed for your body during fasting. --------------------------------------------------------- Do not skip Suhoor: Dieticians warn that those who are fasting should not skip the morning meal as this is needed to get you through the day. Many people eat a late night meal and sleep through till the dawn prayers. This is not advisable. Self-discipline: As Ramadan fasting is basically an exercise in self-discipline; for those who are chain smokers; food nibblers or caffeine addicts (coffee; tea; coke; and chocolate); it is a good opportunity to break the habit; hoping that the effect will continue when the month is over. It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. --------------------------------------------------------- Fasting and weight loss: Fasting is a good way of losing weight; however some people even put on weight during Ramadan. The basic equation is simple &#8211; you must balance the calories that you take in with the calories that go out. If you consistently eat more calories than you burn; you will tend to store up the excess as fat. Exercising will help you maintain your body weight; it will help burn calories and get rid of stress. ---------------------------------------------------------</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Are the Brits puppets of Uncle Sam</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>The brits showing their dirty face now that the olympics are over...... Ecuador was due to announce its decision on granting asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Thursday as it slammed Britain for threatening to storm Quito's mission in London to retrieve him. Assange; an Australian national and former computer hacker; came to global attention after his website published a trove of secret documents that hugely embarrassed several governments; most notably the United States; in 2010. Ecuador on Wednesday hit out at Britain for threatening to storm its London mission to arrest Assange; while WikiLeaks said such action would be "a hostile and extreme act; which is not proportionate to the circumstances." Those disclosures were the biggest intelligence leak in US history; but in London the focus was on Britain's right to remove Assange from the embassy; should they wish to do so; and the diplomatic furore that could ensue. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said it would be "unacceptable" for British police to enter the embassy. He noted that his country "has made a decision" on Assange and would announce it in Quito at 7:00 am (1200 GMT). Patino said Wednesday that Ecuador had received "an express threat in writing" from Britain "that they could storm our embassy if Ecuador does not hand over Julian Assange." "Ecuador rejects in the strongest terms the explicit threat made in Britain's official communication;" Patino told reporters. "The position taken by the government of Britain is unacceptable; both from the political and the legal point of view;" he said; warning that entering the embassy without authorisation "would be a flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention" on diplomatic relations. Assange took refuge at the embassy on June 19 to avoid extradition to Sweden; which he claims plans to eventually surrender him to US authorities. Assange's mother and the Spanish former judge Baltasar Garzon; who is helping to represent him; recently travelled to Ecuador to argue on his behalf.</RelQBody>

My husband still couldn't sponsor me and my baby here because his salary is under the bracket required for family visa.

I know Freelance Visa is quite expensive but i want to know if there's somebody whom we can buy visa from that we can just pay monthly basis?

			<RelQSubject>What I have learnt and still learning....</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>- That you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone who can be loved. The rest is up to them. - That no matter how much I care; some people just don't care back. - That it takes years to build up trust; and only seconds to destroy it. - That it's not what you have in your life but who you have in your life that counts. - That you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that; you'd better know something. - That it's not what happens to people that's important. It's what they do about it. - That you can do something in an instant that will give you heartache for life. - That you should always leave loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them. - That either you control your attitude or it controls you. - That regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first; the passion fades and there had better be something else to take its place. - That learning to forgive takes practice. - That money is a lousy way of keeping score. - That sometimes when I'm angry I have the right to be angry; but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel. - That true friendship continues to grow; even over the longest distance. Same goes for true love. - That maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many years you've lived. - That you should never tell a child their dreams are unlikely or outlandish. Few things are more humiliating; and what a tragedy it would be if they believed you. - That no matter how good a friend is; they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that. - That it isn't always enough to be forgiven by others. Sometimes you have to learn to forgive yourself. - That no matter how bad your heart is broken the world doesn't stop for your grief. - That just because two people argue; it doesn't mean they don't love each other and just because they don't argue; it doesn't mean they do. - That sometimes you have to put the individual ahead of their actions. - That you shouldn't be so eager to find out a secret. It could change your life forever. - That no matter how you try to protect your children; they will eventually get hurt and you will hurt in the process. - That there are many ways of falling and staying in love. - That your life can be changed in a matter of hours by people who don't even know you. - That even when you think you have no more to give; when a friend cries out to you; you will find the strength to help. - That writing; as well as talking; can ease emotional pains. - That credentials on the wall do not make you a decent human being. - That the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon. Happy weekend everyone:)</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Ban confusion .....</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Dear all; I was wondering if anyone has the actual answer ... I am seriously planning to leave Qatar and go work in the UAE . I am tired of working very underpaid; 6 days a week; 10 hours a day ; and salaries getting paid two weeks late for no reason at all . Anyway ; my company won't give NOC even if I came back to Doha with my own money; they didn't take me here . I work under threat and blackmail like ''if u don't like it this way you can leave'' . I have my two children here ; they live with their father; and I have done lots of sacrifices to come back to Doha and now I am not even being compensated for the job I do . Anyway; I have always knew that the infamous two year ban means only not being allowed to work in Qatar for two years but I can still come and visit . Now for the first time I heard that for two years is not allowed to even enter the Country as a tourist .... I have always heard it of two different things ; as someone who used to work with me left two months ago; but is now here on a visit so it sounds really weird to me ... does it depend on something in particular ?</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Qatar airline flight attendants make safety</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Occasionally airline flight attendants make an effort to make the in-flight safety lecture a bit more entertaining. Here are some real examples that have been heard or reported: As we prepare for takeoff; please make sure your tray tables and seat backs are fully upright in their most uncomfortable position. There may be 50 ways to leave your lover; but there are only 6 ways out of this airplane Your seat cushions can be used for floatation; and in the event of an emergency water landing; please take them with our compliments. We do feature a smoking section on this flight if you must smoke; contact a member of the flight crew and we will escort you to the wing of the airplane. Smoking in the lavatories is prohibited. Any person caught smoking in the lavatories will be asked to leave the plane immediately. Pilot -Folks; we have reached our cruising altitude now; so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to move about as youwish; but please stay inside the plane till we land .it's a bit cold outside; and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern. And; after landing Thank you for flying Qatar Airways 5 star Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.As we waited just off the runway for another airliner to cross in front of us; some of the passengers were beginning to retrieve luggage from the overhead bins. The head attendant announced on the intercom; This aircraft is equipped with a video surveillance system that monitors the cabin during taxiing. Any passengers not remaining in their seats until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop at the gate will be strip-searched as they leave the aircraft.?</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Here is a math trick so unbelievable that it will stump you. Personally I would like to know who came up with this and why that person is not running the country. Grab a calculator or use the one that is on your computer. (You won't be able to do this one in your Head) 1. Key in the first three digits of your phone number (NOT the Area code ) 2. Multiply by 80 3. Add 1 4. Multiply by 250 5. Add to this the last 4 digits of your phone number 6. Add to this the last 4 digits of your phone number again. 7. Subtract 250 8. Divide number by 2 Do you recognise the answer?</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Bahrain - Democracy should be the answer</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Bahrain girl reads freedom poem; jailed Bahrain's security forces are increasingly targeting women in their campaign against prodemocracy protesters despite Wednesday's lifting martial law in the island kingdom. Ayat al-Gormezi ; 20; a poet and student arrested two months ago after reading out a poem at a prodemocracy rally; is due to go on trial before a military tribunal ; her mother said. Ayat was forced to turn herself in when masked cops threatened to kill her brothers unless she did so. She has not been seen since her arrest ; though her mother did talk to her once by phone and Ayat said that she had been forced to sign a false confession . Her mother has since been told that her daughter has been in a military hospital after being tortured. "We are the people who will kill humiliation and assassinate misery;" a film captures Ayat telling a cheering crowd in Pearl Square in February. "We are the people who will destroy the foundation of injustice."</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Help!!!Can my Husband Bring my sister in a family visit visa in Qatar?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>My Husband has a valid RP. i am not under his sponsorship. is it possible for him to bring my sister on a family visa (which i believe can be extended for a total of 6 months?). i was asking this because i wanted to bring my sister on board ASAP as i will give birth next month. my husband has a higher salary compared to mine so i thought it is easier for us to have the extension if he will be the one to sponsor my sister. Please help! Thank you</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Words from the Past</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Words from the Past There will be plenty of moments in your life when you might have said something to someone; at that time the words just came up in your mind and you just said them bluntly but later on the true meaning of those; you will come to know when you have really learned the lesson of life in a hard way. Yes everyone does that in their life these things sometime arise suddenly and will put a smile on your face. Because you come to realize that how important you were to someone then. There are many moments in my life where I have said something to someone. Ah! It&#8217;s a bitter truth that we cannot change our past. Smart people in this world do not live in their past but it does not mean that they have totally come out of it. It&#8217;s just they have learned the art of staying well in the present and they always try to create such events / moments that they had in their past without anyone noticing it. Qaisar</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Agony Continue</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Before I came here in Qatar I'd thought that it will be a good start to build up my dreams but when I was here it suddenly changed. I came here in Doha with tourist visa expecting that I can easily find a job. My girlfriend help me to process the papers because she was already 6 months in here. Going here is easy but being here starts my headache. To make the story short my girlfriend got a visa from illegal person and make money on us. In my 1 month tourist visa I found a job that at first I thought it would be a good starting point. I was hired as a sales executive on one of Filipino magazine here in DOHA(quite comfortable at first because I am a Filipino). They have a lot of promises that nothing was been made. They said they will provide transport; gave phone allowance and most of all fix my visa that is already expired. In my 3 month in that company no promises was been made; I don't have my transport; no phone allowance; very delayed salary and the worst is they didn't fixed my visa T_T which started me to worry because of the penalty I'm going to pay. I keep on reminding them and begging to fix my visa which quite helpful because they told me that I will undergo medical and fingerprint. So I've done medical and fingerprint; but on the 4th month on my job another problem happened. The sponsor just told me that I was fired because one of my workmate which get his passport in the office w/o asking permission to our sponsor and never come back to work. Our sponsor got mad and I'm the one he blame for what my workmate did. So everything going to be harsh in Qatar. I've work on that company for 6 months and in my last 2 months of being there I didn't got my salary. They released me from that company because the sponsor and the management got problem on finance. First I thought that it will be a good opportunity to look for another job but it makes me wrong. Mostly the company is looking for transferable visa. I pay my flat rent my food and no work until now. My visa is 6 months and I need more month to be transferable.... My agony continues day by day thinking how to pay my bills and survive in this dessert land.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>The "k" dilemma Visited one of my friend. She has a beautiful daughter and she named her "kshirin"... reminds me of the big time numerology or "k" fad going on in India with movie [ Kaho na&#8230;.. to Krish] and TV [ Kyoki Saas&#8230;&#8230;to Kahani Ghar&#8230;&#8230;]soap names starting from "k". apparently it is the lucky charm. Mallus too got influenced by this charm and named Cochin as Kochi and Calicut as Kozhikode; though they already have K charm &#8211; Kerala. Luckily no Kuttappan ruling Qatar or else he would have changed Qatar to &#8220;Kataram&#8221; like Quilon to Kollam. I remember; some grain of rice stuck beneath my key "k" in the keyboard which was making me press the key "k" extra hard. Don't know if the absence of "k" is a bad luck charm but when my brother asked opinion about a girl from matrimonial; he got my reply - &#8220;She is looing good in western dresses&#8221;</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>QR319;000 collected in fines from smokers</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>DOHA: Long criticised for non-existent enforcement of anti-smoking law; Qatar&#8217;s public health authorities have swung into action and handed out fines to some 829 people so far this year for lighting up in public places. And the fines the health inspectors collected from the violators totalled an impressive QR319;000 &#8212; which means that on average a smoker caught paid QR385 in fine. The places raided by the inspectors included popular hangouts like the City Centre; The Mall; Villaggio; Hyatt Plaza; Landmark and Royal Plaza; among others. Interestingly; the health inspectors didn&#8217;t spare government offices; including ministry buildings; and raided them as well and caught violators. Responsible for ensuring a smoke-free Qatar; the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) said in a release yesterday that inspectors from its anti-tobacco unit conducted 1;330 raids between January and mid-November this year at public places where smoking is banned. The SCH has reiterated in its release it would intensify monitoring and conduct more raids; especially as many violators were caught in shops located closer to schools. The SCH campaign assumes significance as it comes ahead of a law that is reported to be on the anvil; and; which many expect; could see the mushrooming &#8216;sheesha&#8217; joints; especially in residential localities and near schools; close down. During the latest anti-tobacco campaign of the SCH; however; what is surprising is that no &#8216;sheesha&#8217; outlet has been raided by its inspectors and no fines have been handed out to users to &#8216;sheesha&#8217; addicts; who; understandably; also include an increasing number of women and children. The current anti-tobacco law is described by anti-smoking activists as weak and lacking teeth as the punitive measures provided for are not deterring enough. Official figures suggest that some 16 percent of the Qatari population is addicted to smoking; and that includes &#8216;sheesha&#8217; as well. School students aren&#8217;t immune. A survey has recently been conducted by public health authorities to determine the extent to which smoking is prevalent in schools. Its findings are expected to help the SCH come up with ways that are effective enough in fighting this menace among youngsters. The authorities have recently made it mandatory for cigarette packets being sold in the local market to carry graphic images of deadly ailments smoking can cause; but its impact on the prevalence of smoking in the country is yet to be assessed. Some youngsters; instead of kicking the habit; have begun buying small steel &#8212; and sometimes silver &#8212; boxes so they could shift the cigarettes from what is a repulsive looking pack to a fancy case.

			<RelQSubject>Who Runs The World Today?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>From Ifancy To Adulthood: From the moment we are born we are barraged by manipulation; conditioning; and pressure to become the image of what is around us. As kid's we're led to believe that we must conform to what society tells us and basically give in to the norms laid out to us. It's easy to see; just take a look at the relationship between the current fad and children or teens. The only reason it is popular is because it is presented to kids constantly through the various media outlets (radio; commercials; magazines; etc.) which imbeds the idea that it is "cool" or "hip" in our brains. It's simple psychology that if you show someone who isn't consciously aware of what is going on something enough times they will begin to form somewhat of a bond with the object or item. The popularity of music is a prime example; sales and popularity are not one bit based on artistry or talent they are purely based on who gets the most exposure; or in better terms who gets marketed best and who has the biggest budget. Hip Hop artist Joe Budden put it in layman's terms in the song Microphone when he said in one line; "fuck record sales or who the machine markets best;" it couldn't be more true. The reason that this is important and has major significance is because it proves that we are easily controllable and that we can be directed towards the goals of those in control.</RelQBody>

I have an opportunity to teach abroad in Doha and I'm getting nervous that I will not be able to bring my child with me. I have sole legal and physical custody of my child; his father is on the birth certificate and all the legal documents in the U.S. are up-to-date. Can someone point me in the right direction for accurate information? I've read so many conflicting rules and I'm not sure which is the most current and accurate information.

			<RelQSubject>A teacher's lesson ( very emotional story )</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>There is a story many years ago of an elementary teacher. Her name was Mrs. Thompson. And as she stood in front of her 5th grade class on the very first day of school; she told the children a lie. Like most teachers; she looked at her students and said that she loved them all the same. But that was impossible; because there in the front row; slumped in his seat; was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard. Mrs. Thompson had watched Teddy the year before and noticed that he didn&#8217;t play well with the other children; that his clothes were messy and that he constantly needed a bath. And Teddy could be unpleasant. It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in marking his papers with a broad red pen; making bold X&#8217;s and then putting a big &#8220;F&#8221; at the top of his papers. At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught; she was required to review each child&#8217;s past records and she put Teddy&#8217;s off until last. However; when she reviewed his file; she was in for a surprise. Teddy&#8217;s first grade teacher wrote; &#8220;Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners. He is a joy to be around.&#8221; His second grade teacher wrote; &#8220;Teddy is an excellent student; well liked by his classmates; but he is troubled because his mother has a terminal illness and life at home must be a struggle.&#8221; His third grade teacher wrote; &#8220;His mother&#8217;s death has been hard on him. He tries to do his best but his father doesn&#8217;t show much interest and his home life will soon affect him if some steps aren&#8217;t taken.&#8221; Teddy&#8217;s fourth grade teacher wrote; &#8220;Teddy is withdrawn and doesn&#8217;t show much interest in school. He doesn&#8217;t have many friends and sometimes sleeps in class.&#8221; By now; Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents; wrapped in beautiful ribbons and bright paper; except for Teddy&#8217;s. His present which was clumsily wrapped in the heavy; brown paper that he got from a grocery bag. Mrs. Thompson took pains to open it in the middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing; and a bottle that was one quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children&#8217;s laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was; putting it on; and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist. Teddy Stoddard stayed after school that day just long enough to say; &#8220;Mrs. Thompson; today you smelled just like my Mom used to.&#8221; After the children left she cried for at least an hour. On that very day; she quit teaching reading; and writing; and arithmetic. Instead; she began to teach children. Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with him; his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him; the faster he responded. By the end of the year; Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class and; despite her lie that she would love all the children the same; Teddy became one of her &#8220;teacher&#8217;s pets.&#8221; A year later; she found a note under her door; from Teddy; telling her that she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Six years went by before she got another note from Teddy. He then wrote that he had finished high school; third in his class; and she was still the best teacher he ever had in his whole life. Four years after that; she got another letter; saying that while things had been tough at times; he&#8217;d stayed in school; had stuck with it; and would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. He assured Mrs. Thompson that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had in his whole life. Then four more years passed and yet another letter came. This time he explained that after he got his bachelor&#8217;s degree; he decided to go a little further. The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer&#8212;the letter was signed; Theodore F. Stoddard; M.D. The story doesn&#8217;t end there. You see; there was yet another letter that spring. Teddy said he&#8217;d met this girl and was going to be married. He explained that his father had died a couple of years ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom. Of course; Mrs. Thompson did. And guess what? She wore that bracelet; the one with several rhinestones missing. And she made sure she was wearing the perfume that Teddy remembered his mother wearing on their last Christmas together. They hugged each other; and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson&#8217;s ear; &#8220;Thank you Mrs. Thompson for believing in me. Thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference.&#8221; Mrs. Thompson; with tears in her eyes; whispered back. She said; &#8220;Teddy; you have it all wrong. You were the one who taught me that I could make a difference. I didn&#8217;t know how to teach until I met you.&#8221; It&#8217;s O.K. to shed a tear or two. I know I did. Good Day.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>CAR FRAUD</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Friends; I am looking out for buying a car and when ever I open the qatar living web site I find one Fraud person making advertisement for selling his car for very cheap price. For example today he is selling a 2009 model mercedes for only 60;000/=QR. Is it possibel? NO. No mercedes of 2009 model can never be available for so low price. but you might get attracted with the advertisement as the price quote is very low. This Fruad man is not giving his telephone number in the ad and is only giving his e-mail id as ba21dri@live.com. Once you send him a mail; he will send you the following false story. "" Hello; Nice to hear from you. The car is in perfect condition; it has never been involved in any accident (accident-free); no technical problems (engine works perfect); no any scratches or dents on the car body. We both are non-smokers; nobody ever smoked inside the car. The car is qatar spec.All inspections are done and all taxes are paid. The vehicle has a complete service book. (I also accept any test;you can test the car at any mechanic you want.) I must tell you;i just moved with my family in London; United kingdom(this is the reason that the car is cheap) and the car is in Doha;Qatar . The price is 60000 qr THIS IS MY LAST PRICE AND ONLY CASH I have nobody in Doha;Qatar that could show you the car also since I have house;car;garrage keys here with me.I need to come personal to meet you and present the car.Please think twice if you want to buy this car and let me know if you are really interested to buy the car.Please don't spend my time with endless disscutions;or pure curiosity Regards"""" Please do not fall prey to this man. In the next mail he will ask you to send money by weston union. Remain away from this Fraud and inform qatar Living. Pradeep Gupta</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>what we can do in this heat</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion is the body&#8217;s response to an excessive loss of the water and salt contained in sweat. Those most prone to heat exhaustion are elderly people; people with high blood pressure and people working or exercising in a hot environment. Warning Signs of Heat Exhaustion Include: Heavy sweating Paleness Muscle cramps Tiredness and weakness Dizziness or fainting Headache Nausea or vomiting What to Do Rest in a cool; preferably air-conditioned; area. Loosen clothing. Cool down with a shower; bath or sponge bath Drink plenty of non-alcoholic and caffeine-free beverages. Seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or last longer than one hour. Heat Stroke (Life Threatening) Heat stroke occurs when the body becomes unable to control its temperature: the body&#8217;s temperature rises rapidly; the sweating mechanism fails; and the body is unable to cool down. Heat stroke can develop within minutes or hours. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not given. Treatment includes rapidly lowering the person&#8217;s body temperature followed by intensive supportive care. Warning Signs of Heat Stroke Vary But May Include: Extremely high body temperature (above 103&#176; F orally) Red; hot and dry skin (no sweating) Rapid pulse Throbbing headache Dizziness Nausea Confusion Unconsciousness What to Do Call for immediate medical assistance. Move the victim to a cool or shady area. Cool the victim rapidly using whatever methods you can. (For example; immerse the victim in a tub of cool water; place in a cool shower; spray with cool water from a garden hose or sponge with cool water. Avoid use of fans; see paragraphs below.) Monitor body temperature; and continue cooling efforts until the body temperature drops to 101-102&#176; F. Do not give the victim alcohol to drink. Get medical assistance as soon as possible. How To Prevent Heat-Related Illness Be aware of the warning signs of heat-related illness; such as light-headedness; mild nausea or confusion; sleepiness or profuse sweating. While outdoors; rest frequently in a shady area so that your body's thermostat has a chance to recover. Schedule outdoor activities carefully; preferably before noon or in the evening; If unaccustomed to working or exercising in a hot environment; start slowly; pick up the pace gradually and limit your exercise or work time. Wear sunscreen to protect skin from the sun's harmful rays. Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself and causes a loss of body fluids. Wear lightweight; light-colored; loose-fitting clothing. When working in the heat; monitor the condition of your co-workers and have someone do the same for you. If you are 65 years of age or older; have a friend or relative call to check on you twice a day when hot weather health advisories have been issued. Stay indoors and in an air-conditioned environment. If air conditioning is not available; consider a visit to a shopping mall; public library; movie theater; supermarket or other air-conditioned location for a few hours. Increase your fluid intake&#8212;regardless of your activity level. Don't wait until you feel thirsty to drink fluids. Ensure infants and children drink adequate amounts of liquids. Avoid drinks containing caffeine; alcohol; or large amounts of sugar because they will actually cause you to lose more fluid. Also; avoid very cold beverages because they can cause stomach cramps. Electric fans may be useful to increase comfort and to draw cool air into your home at night; but do not rely on a fan as your primary cooling device during a heat wave. When the temperature is in the upper 90s or higher; a fan will not prevent heat-related illness. A cool shower or bath is a more effective way to cool off. (See paragraphs below. Check regularly on those at greatest risk of heat-related illness: infants and children up to 4 years of age people 65 years of age or older people who are overweight people who overexert during work or exercise people who are ill or on certain medications Avoid hot foods and heavy meals. Ask your doctor whether medications you take affect your body's response to the heat. Do not leave infants; children or pets unattended in a parked car or other hot environment. Use of Fans for Cooling In order for a fan to be effective; the skin surface must be moist. When the skin surface is moist; moving air removes heat from the skin as the moisture evaporates. Unfortunately; when a person begins to develop heat stroke; they stop sweating. In addition; elderly persons may not sweat due to poor heat regulation messages sent out by their brain centers. If a fan is to be effective; the skin must be moist either with sweat; or with dampened clothing; or with moisture added by rubbing wet cloths over the skin surface. Although fans are less expensive to operate; they may not be effective as indicated above; and may even be harmful; when temperatures are very high. As the air temperature rises; air flow is increasingly ineffective in cooling the body until finally; at temperatures above about 100&#176; F (the exact number varies with the humidity) increasing air movement actually increases heat stress. More specifically; when the temperature of the air rises to about 100&#176; F; the fan may be delivering overheated air to the skin at a rate that exceeds the capacity of the body to get rid of this heat; even with sweating; and the net effect is to add heat rather than to cool the body. The widespread distribution of fans; often practiced in the past as a heat-relief measure; thus appears unlikely to be particularly effective in preventing major heat-related health effects when temperatures are very high. The better alternative by far when the temperature soars is to use an air conditioner if one is available or to seek shelter in an air-conditioned building.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>I am working for a business consultancy office. I am very comfortable with my boss. I receive my salary regularly without fail. Having good accommodation and car. The issue here is he is not using me for what I am employed. I have asked him so many times but he says you just sit and talk to the people whomever I send to you. Some people comes to me with angry face; some will come with confusion; some will come with frustration; like this every day I will deal with deferent kind of people. The problem here is I don&#8217;t understand for what they are coming to me and they don&#8217;t understand what I am talking to them. But whoever comes to me finally they will laugh at me or bang my table and go. The problem here is how long this will continue? I do not understand what my exact position is.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>It will take just 37 seconds to read this</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Two men; both seriously ill; occupied the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families; their homes; their jobs; their involvement in the military service; where they had been on vacation.. Every afternoon; when the man in the bed by the window could sit up; he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and colour of the world outside. The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every colour and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite details; the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine this picturesque scene. One warm afternoon; the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man could not hear the band - he could see it in his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days; weeks and months passed. One morning; the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window; who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate; the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch; and after making sure he was comfortable; she left him alone. Slowly; painfully; he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window besides the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said; 'Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.' Epilogue: There is tremendous happiness in making others happy; despite our own situations. Shared grief is half the sorrow; but happiness when shared; is doubled. If you want to feel rich; just count all the things you have that money can't buy. 'Today is a gift; that is why it is called The Present .' The origin of this letter is unknown; but please pass it on.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Nice Teaching</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>First-year students at Veterinary school were attending their first Anatomy class; with a real dead animal. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a White sheet. The professor started the class by telling them; 'In Veterinary Medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a Doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the Animal body'. For an example; the Professor pulled back the sheet; touched his finger in the mouth of the dead animal; withdrew it and put his Finger in his mouth. 'Go ahead and do the same thing;' he told his students. The students freaked out; hesitated for several minutes. But eventually took turns putting their finger in the mouth of the dead pig and tasted in their mouth. When everyone finished; the Professor looked at them and said; 'The Second most important quality is observation. I touched with my middle Finger and tasted on my index finger. Now learn to pay attention Moral of the story: Life is Tough but its a lot tougher when you are stupid</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Google Boss in Net Info Warning!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>THE boss of internet giant Google has warned about the dangers of putting too much personal information on the web. Eric Schmidt said kids who use social networking websites extensively may eventually have to change their names on reaching adulthood to escape their online pasts. He added that the hundreds of millions of web users worldwide who post personal information on the net may not be aware how dangerous it is. Mr Schmidt said: "I don't believe society understands what happens when everything is available; knowable and recorded by everyone all the time." Despite his concerns; he described social networking site Facebook as a "company of consequence". Google itself has a wealth of information on web users. It handles billions of emails through Gmail and has pictures of millions of people's houses on Google Street View. The web giant also has information on users based on their online searches. And Mr Schmidt believes the future of Google will rely on the company storing more and more personal information. He told Google's users: "We know roughly who you are; roughly what you care about; roughly who your friends are." Source: The Sun</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>(UN) Lucky day to remember</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I don't know if I consider this day as a lucky or unlucky or both (maybe!) day for me. For how many times; we almost had an accident three or four times because of the reckless; undisciplined "muk mafi" drivers who are seem like cows on the loose. Darn! I was holding to my dear seat and held my breath as I waited for the head-on collision that happened somewhere in salwa road this morning. I don't know if there's a divine intervention but miraculously seems like time elapsed and my driver had a chance to turn the car on the left side. My God I can't imagine if the other car had bumped us and crashed us like a canned soda. I'm sure I'll be a dead meat by now. This just brings me down to the memory lane; reminiscing the first ever accident I had and the worst is it happened here in Doha. Having a first hand accident is one of the worst part of my life. I just can't forget that fateful day of February when our company car was bumped by a speeding car and to think that he's suppose not to run fast in an intersection right? I had to wait for almost one hour for the ambulance and the police to arrive on the scene and to investigate the accident. Seems like eternity after the rescuers arrived and brought me to the hospital. During the travel to Hamad Hospital; my life flashes back before me. My family; my friends; my colleagues; the happy and sad episodes of my life played like a rerun movie..This really brings chill down to my spine..Sometimes; because of this worst scenario in the road here in Doha; I almost quit my job and pursue a new one only if not of this sponsorship that's holding my neck that I can't able to resign despite that I really wanted to..Meeting our clients is always a deem part of my job -- unfortunately..Anyhow; as I analyze the circumstances I realized I'M STILL LUCKY after all because I still have the chance to make things right and I still had a chance to live and to do what's my purpose why I'm here right now..I know that it will take time that the traumas of my accidents will vanish into thin air but I won't let this impede me to do what I ought to do..Thanks God I'm still alive and kicking and thanks for George Cayley for inventing the seatbelt that always saved my life for not crashing in the windshield and flew out..lol..To make a joke of the situation; sometimes I always kid my colleagues that I must do a last will of testament before something bad will happen to me..It's always like your one foot is in the grave whenever you're in the road here in Doha..</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Work Visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I got my work visa today and noticed that it is only valid for 3 months. To verify what type of visa was issued since it was written in Arabic; I logged on the website of the Ministry of Interior. I found out that it is a work visit visa single entry. Can anybody explain to me the difference of a work visa from a work visit visa and work permit and also a residence visa and a residence permit. What will my employer issue to me upon the expiration of my work visit visa while I am in Qatar? Thanks.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>I dont understand very well. I have heard/read that sometimes workers cannot go out of Qatar even if they are willing to; because the contractor has taken out their passports. They cannot go to their embassy to issue a new one? As far as I know in case your passport is lost; or stolen you can go to your embassy and request for a new one (maybe it is not inmediate; maybe it is not for free... but they have to issue you a new one). I understand; that other absolutely different problem is the payment of the flight.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Indian Cricket Team will lose again</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I have been watching tha match between India and Srilanka and was really astonished to see the poor performance of Indian Bowlers. Why do India still keep a Bowler like Yadav who was not performing in the last two matches. His economy is above 7 and India should have someone who can bowl well. Their seamers are all having very bad economy and why dont they try some new bowlers rather than carrying the players like Vinai Kumar and Yadav. I am afraid that India will possibly lose this match also like they lost the last one to Aussies. Sri Lanka has accumulated a very good score of 289 which will be difficult for Indian team to follow.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>when a girl......</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>When a GIRL is quiet ... millions of things are running in her mind.. When a GIRL is not arguing ... she is thinking deeply. When a GIRL looks at u with eyes full of questions ... she is wondering how long you will be around. When a GIRL answers ' I'm fine ' after a few seconds ... she is not at all fine. When a GIRL stares at you she is wondering why you are lying. When a GIRL lays on your chest .. she is wishing for you to be hers forever. When a GIRL wants to see you everyday... she wants to be pampered. When a GIRL says ' I love you ' .. she means it. When a GIRL says ' I miss you ' .... no one in this world can miss you more than that. Life only comes around once make sure u spend it with the right person .... Find a guy .. who calls you beautiful instead of hot. who calls you back when you hang up on him. who will stay awake just to watch you sleep. Wait for the guy who ... kisses your forehead. Who wants to show you off to the world when you are in your sweats. Who holds your hand in front of his friends. Who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares about you and how lucky he is to have you. Who turns to his friends and says; ' That's her!! '</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>'Win a Wife' contest sparks outrage</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Is this bad taste or just a contest where the winner actually WINS ! A New Zealand radio station has been criticised for running a contest giving male listeners the chance to win a wife. The winner of The Rock FM's competition will be flown to Ukraine for 12 nights to pick their future wife from a bride agency. "If you're interested in holy matrimony with a potentially hot foreign chick; fill it out to the best of your abilities." Not to be put off by the complaints; numerous men have entered the competition and appear happy to have their profiles shown on the radio's website. Defending the station; The Rock FM program director; Brad King; said the competition was "a bit of a laugh". "At the end of the day; it's up to both people if they decide to get married and return to New Zealand. We're not actually marrying anyone or bringing women back to New Zealand;" he said. However; social activist Sue Bradford said the competition took "commercial radio to new depths". "It is unusual and somewhat disturbing that a commercial entity would commercialise what should be one of the most meaningful human relationships and actually offer it as a prize for a radio show;" she said.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Job at FBI</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>The FBI had an opening for an assassin. After all the background checks; interviews and testing were done; there were 3 finalists; Two men and a woman. For the final test; the FBI agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed Him a gun. 'We must know that you will follow your Instructions no matter what the circumstances. Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair ... Kill her!!' The man said; 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said; 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.' The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was Quiet for a bout 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes; 'I tried; but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said; 'You don't Have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.' Finally; it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions; to kill her husband. She took the Gun and went into the room. Shots were heard; one After another. They heard screaming; crashing; Banging on the walls. After a few minutes; all was Quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the Woman; wiping the sweat from her brow. 'This gun is loaded with blanks' she said. 'I had to beat him to death with the chair.' MORAL:. Don't mess with &#8220;WOMAN&#8221;</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>I worked in Dubai for 3 years as a Personal Assistant to the Director and Managing Director in a private Group of Companies; unfortunately bcoz of the recession; the business closed; same time as my contract finished so i decided to go back home here in Manila; i just arrived exactly a month ago (09 Aug.). Given a chance; i want to work there in Doha Qatar. I asked already about Visas to some resources; like tourist visa is around 1200QR (1:1 ratio to UAE Dirhams). I am looking for a sponsor in which he/she can provide the sponsorship under the company so that he/she will pay only like around 200QR. That would be a big discount! Or hopefully you have job vacancies in your offices. (Office works; sales; marketing; media; etc.) Thank u in advance for the responses. God bless. Mabuhay ang mga KABAYAN!</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>How To Dump A Partner</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>(I thought this standardized form would help simplify the dating process and make it more business-like.) Dear _______________; I regret to inform you that you have been eliminated from further contention as Mr. Right. As you are probably aware; the competition was exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified candidates such as yourself also failed to make the final cut. I will; however; keep your name on file should an opening come available. So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors; please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition: (Check those that apply) ___Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it; hyphenating it; or subjecting my children to it. ___Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion. ___The fact that our first dining experience to date has left MY wallet a little lighter; and YOUR pants a little tighter! ___Your inadvertent admission that you "buy condoms by the truckload" indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my personality. ___You failed the 20 Question Rule; i.e.; I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself. ___Your legs are skinnier than mine. If you can FIT into my pants; then you can't GET into my pants. ___You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess. ___You're too tall. I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying to kiss you. ___You have a hairy back. ___I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing. ___The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable. ___The phrase "My Mother" has popped up far too often in conversation. ___Although I do enjoy the X-Files; I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms a little disconcerting. ___Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker. ___Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a long term partner. ___Your height is out of proportion to your weight. If you should; however; happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches; please resubmit your application. ___Somehow I doubt those condoms that I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip. ___I am out of your league; set your sights lower next time. Sincerely; _________________________________</RelQBody>

Employees will sign contracts to work and must see out their contracts - anyone who wants to leave before the end of their contract to shift to a new company must pay their way out of the contract (amount I imagine will be pre-determined before signing the contract) I am not confirming this and honestly can't see it happening - has anyone else heard anything similar?</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Help Needed! Japan Appeal - re: Shipment.</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>We had this appeal - Backpacks for the Children of Japan here in Doha recently. The original target was for about 100 backpacks. The response was overwhelming and the number of backpacks collected by the dateline was almost 1700 backpacks and with 250-300 boxes. The US base could not ship for free anymore because of the huge number. It would come to about QR 35;000 for the shipment. We were hoping to find a company; organization; or individual who would be able to help us in shipping them to Tokyo; Japan at no cost. We really appreciate your assistance and cooperation in this cause.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Suicide: Read This First</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>If you are feeling suicidal now; please stop long enough to read this. It will only take about five minutes. I do not want to talk you out of your bad feelings. I am not a therapist or other mental health professional - only someone who knows what it is like to be in pain. I don't know who you are; or why you are reading this page. I only know that for the moment; you're reading it; and that is good. I can assume that you are here because you are troubled and considering ending your life. If it were possible; I would prefer to be there with you at this moment; to sit with you and talk; face to face and heart to heart. But since that is not possible; we will have to make do with this. I have known a lot of people who have wanted to kill themselves; so I have some small idea of what you might be feeling. I know that you might not be up to reading a long book; so I am going to keep this short. While we are together here for the next five minutes; I have five simple; practical things I would like to share with you. I won't argue with you about whether you should kill yourself. But I assume that if you are thinking about it; you feel pretty bad. Well; you're still reading; and that's very good. I'd like to ask you to stay with me for the rest of this page. I hope it means that you're at least a tiny bit unsure; somewhere deep inside; about whether or not you really will end your life. Often people feel that; even in the deepest darkness of despair. Being unsure about dying is okay and normal. The fact that you are still alive at this minute means you are still a little bit unsure. It means that even while you want to die; at the same time some part of you still wants to live. So let's hang on to that; and keep going for a few more minutes. Start by considering this statement: Suicide is not chosen; it happens when pain exceeds resources for coping with pain.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Garvey's Jam night (musicians wanting bands)</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I read many posts of people wanting to jam or get a band going; myself included. I went to Garvey's over the weekend and saw that there was a Jam night tomorrow at 7:00. I suggest that anybody that wants to get together to ether scout musicians or find the missing link to your own formation to come down and get a massive number of willing music fanatics together and maybe one or 2 bands can come to life. I think most of us write a post and wait for the perfect match and end up with doing nothing. God knows we can use more bands in Doha. Hope to see you there.</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Like many people today; I have big dreams and goals. I have desires in my heart.

If my plans don&#8217;t work out; no big deal; I know God has something better.

I applied for a new passport with ecnr and in my previous passport under which the visa was issued had no surname. so the new passport was with a surname but i was told i cannot travel because the name in visa is different. so i applied for a new passport again with name same as first one. Now the changes have to be made in my visa( i am assuming its only passport number which changes). Can anyone pls tell me if it can be done without any problem and how long will it take?

Gosh how many more lives have to be wasted on Doha roads before the govt implemented tougher laws against these sorts of activities! What&#8217;s even more upsetting is that I came back to office and saw a popular Qatari group on FB posted this pic! This type of manic should not be promoted or encouraged. As we all know; it doesn't always happen in the desert it happens right here in Doha at roundabouts we all use. Cars have a simple purpose; to take us from point A to B they're not toys.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>New Zealand Family that Lost Toddler Triplets</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Two-year-old Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes were among the 13 children killed in the fire which broke out in the Villaggio Mall in Doha. The grandfather of the triplets killed in a blaze at a daycare centre in a Doha shopping mall says he struggles to see how he will ever be happy again. The fire ripped through the Gympanzee childcare centre in the Villaggio (correct) mall in the capital Doha at 11.30 am (8 pm NZT); killing 19 people and injuring 17. New Zealand-born triplets Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes; aged two; were among those killed in the fire. They were the only children of expats Jane and Martin Weekes. The grandfather of the triplets; Ron Turner; told Newstalk ZB he and his wife would be travelling to Doha tonight to be with their daughter and son-in-law. They had been contacted by Ms Weekes just after the babies had been found and were told they had died of smoke inhalation. "She was still just as numb I suppose; and just as empty as my wife and I feel right now and the rest of our family and friends who have rallied around to give us support. " The triplets had been going to the day-care three mornings a week for the past couple of months; Mr Turner said. "That gave them an opportunity to meet more children and be involved in a different environment than home and mum and dad and nannies; and they were so proud to show off their school bags.'' The triplets' bodies would be brought back to New Zealand; he said. Just last week Ms Weekes wrote on babycenter.com of potty training the trio. "We have about 7 potties around our living space (it's a really big open plan area and is tiled so we have no issues with accidents) and in the bathroom to be able to sit one on the toilet with a kiddy seat and 1 or 2 on the potties if it turned into rush.'' New Zealand journalist Tarek Bazley; who lives 1km from the mall in Doha; was in another part of the mall with his children when the fire broke out. "The first thing I heard of it was a very benign fire alarm; it sounded more like a doorbell to be honest; repeating in the background;'' he told Radio New Zealand. After 15 minutes he asked an attendant whether he should be worried; but was told to "sit tight'' and that it was usually a false alarm. "About 10 minutes later; someone else; a member of the public; raced through this area and said; `Everybody out; you've got to get out now. The other half of the mall is on fire.' That is what he said to me.'' "I believe the problem was that once the fire took in the area near the nursery; there was no way to actually escape.'' Both exits were blocked by smoke; he said. The alarm and sprinkler system appeared to have malfunctioned. "It's an extraordinary mall in the sense that as you walk down it it has this ceiling that is like a mock sky; so I think in order to achieve that effect; they've actually not put in sprinklers in this area.'' Fire-fighters had to break through the roof to get to trapped children after a staircase to the first-floor nursery collapsed; an official said. Dense smoke inside the mall; combined with the fierce temperature from the flames; made reaching the trapped children very difficult; a representative of the civil defence told a news conference. Prime Minister John Key this morning said New Zealand Foreign Affairs staff were travelling to Doha from Saudi Arabia to provide support for the Weekes' family. "Their family are obviously dealing with the terrible grief that they have at this time. Obviously it's a very tragic day for that family.'' Labour leader David Shearer also sent his condolences to the family. "I join with all other New Zealanders in expressing my heartfelt sympathies to the parents; extended family; and friends; of the three young children caught up in such a tragic event. The pain of their loss is unimaginable.</RelQBody>

They send me a man who has some wet plaster ready to apply and says; "plaster" I tell him he needs to find the leak. He doesn't answer; scrapes away the peeling paint and applies the wet plaster. 2 minutes later the painter walks in and paints over the wet plaster. The foreman then arrived and I asked him how that was going to fix the leak? He pointed to the wall and said; "NO MORE LEAK" All I could do at this point was laugh as I couldn't believe how serious he was that the leak was fixed! LOL -I really learn't something new today... all it takes is a plasterer and a painter to fix a leak!</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Mutual Respect</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "A speech will either prosper or ruin a nation." Many relationships break off because of wrong speech. When a couple is too close which each other; we always forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say anything without considering if it would hurt the other party. A friend and her millionaire husband visited their construction site. A worker who wore a helmet saw her and shouted; "Hi; Emily! Remember me? We used to date in the secondary school." On the way home; her millionaire husband teased her; "Luckily you married me. Otherwise you will be the wife of a construction worker." She answered; "You should appreciate that you married me. Otherwise; he will be the millionaire and not you." Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed for a bad relationship. It's like a broken egg - cannot be reversed.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>My Ramadan Memories: childhood Dairies</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>My earliest memories of Ramadan go back to my second or third grade year. But back then I remember Ramadan fell during winter; which meant fairly short days rather than the long burn of summer we&#8217;re experiencing today. The fast day normally ended around 5.30 and by 6:30 we would have prayed Maghrib and I&#8217;m already settled in front of the TV for another hilarious dose of the American Comedy Show &#8220; full house&#8221; and &#8220;wonder years&#8221; while munching on some Mama made Ramadan goodies. But the old days Ramadan was so much different so much fun; well at least for me!. Old days Ramadan wasn&#8217;t just about not eating and drinking forever! For us little folks it was more about motions. We awaited the month with lots of excitement and appreciated its gravity. We spend the day playing between studying and playing football and watching Ramadan kid&#8217;s quiz shows on TV with my cousins. And when night fell over we celebrated our Iftar with relief and gratitude. Mom&#8217;s Knafa never tasted so good. (: it still does actually: P There was a closeness I long to recapture. There are other things I also remember from my childhood Ramadan (: The subtle ache in my belly :P The memory of that first day of Ramadan sneaking in to the kitchen for a bite only to end up being caught by someone ( usually the elder females because they are fussing about the kitchen to make sure Iftar is ready and on time. And then The excitement we little kids felt about accompanying our families to the Tarwahi prayers and all the other little things we enjoyed doing like setting the Iftar table every day. It felt a bit like it felt like my favorite TV show &#8220;Full House&#8221; were the table was set and the family ate together sharing jokes and laughing. I took care of making the juices the napkins; setting out the table and distrusting plates and spoons to everyone It looked stupid but I loved it :P mom thought was ok tough (: These were the memories that made my childhood Ramadan experiences I will never ever really forget. And this is really the essential message of Ramadan; is to be thankful feeling pleasure after deprivation. The sense that what I&#8217;m doing might not change the world; but if it changes me and my perspective of life then it&#8217;s good enough. Now as an adult; I feel Ramadan is slowly losing its meaning; I have at times felt like it&#8217;s been capitalized; commercialized and deluded amid the demands of a capitalistic lifestyle. Relationships and pressures are never the problem; living in a &#8216;non-Muslim&#8217; country where it&#8217;s the exception to fast; not the norm; poses its share of challenges in the workplace. But good news is as adults we still excited about Ramadan and talk about it with anticipation and expectations.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>1st Indian with Legal Drivers licence</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Antony Masla today became the first Indian driver in the State of Qatar to legally obtain his drivers licence after taking the driving test a record 264 times. Antony whose previous driving experience was a cow (5 ltr; milk)in Uttar Pradesh now has the keys to a Toyota LC for his employers. Bungling reported and part time pervert Sheik Midick of the Gulf-Penisular caught up with Antony on his first ever legal drive. 'Like every other Indian in Qatar I had been driving for 12 years without a licence or instruction but I wanted that clear plastic licence to show my family back home that I made it. It took me a while to realise that nudging other cars out of the way was unacceptable and would lead to failure after failure at the driving school. When we rode cows it was ok but now I accept cars are different beasts' When we enquired if there was any downside to having a legal driving licence Antony responded; 'some of my old friends shun me now as they think I have become to good for them; but I'm still the same guy that changes lanes randomly and when he parks I park over the parking lines not between them. I say look at my vehicle; look at the scratches that has not changed! The other thing is all these points on my licence. I'm not sure what they are for; can I exchange them for roti's at Lulu?' On contacting the traffic police for comment they proudly stated that they have now issued 3 driving licences for Indians; one to a Pakistani who unfortunatly has now left the country and 4 to the Nepalese one of which is now the highest qualifed person in his country. The Police Chief added that they have not stopped there and hope to have at least 20 qualified drivers on the road by the end of 2012 at least.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>QATAR MUST UPDATE THE LAW!!!</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Qatar has grown and developed so quickly and massively in the last few years. Its economy; government and people are forces to be reckoned with; locally and in the international arena. There is innovation; imagination and enthusiasm to be found in all aspects of Qatari society as well as in the expat community that calls Qatar its home. There is also much respect for the leaders of this tiny up-and-coming business center. They have demonstrated vision for the development of the country and a concern for their countrymen by educating them and putting them to work to continue the building of their own country. Qatar has been described as a country which "champion(s) the cause of freedom". (The Peninsula; Oct 11; 2010). Meanwhile; Qatar has also invited hundreds of thousands of workers&#8212;skilled and unskilled&#8212;to lend a hand in the building of Qatar. While some of these workers succeed in tucking away tidy nest eggs and returning to their own countries better off; there are others who struggle to realize their earnings or even a decent standard of living while they are here. Much of a worker's fate depends on the benevolence; or lack thereof; of his sponsor&#8212;his salary; living conditions and dismissal&#8212;so much so that the sponsorship system has been compared to modern-day slavery. Some countries have realized that the sponsorship system for workers is outdated; antiquated and unfair to workers. Perhaps those same countries have already realized benefits of having more satisfied foreign workers. Bahrain has done away with the sponsorship structure and Kuwait is scheduled to retire it in February 2011. In keeping with its vision and progressive thinking; Qatar needs to do away with the sponsorship scheme that it has been using up to now. Rather than feeling fearful of allowing workers and employers to move freely between companies without the 2 year penalty; both parties can be relieved of the misery of feeling stuck with an unhappy partner. Employees who aspire to better themselves or look for new challenges can find new opportunities and can take advantage of them; contributing their skills and expertise in a competitive atmosphere; rather than feeling stifled and abused by an archaic system. An important segment of the present working population; namely educated; skilled professionals; will inevitably start feeling resentment towards sponsors who refuse to release them to pursue other opportunities. While seemingly in control of people's fates; Qatar will eventually start losing real talent to other countries; especially to those countries that have eased or will ease the unfair restrictions that make up the sponsorship regulations. Qatar will end up losing talented; knowledgeable professionals because of a stubborn refusal to give up that relatively small amount of control&#8212;a control that is not a fundamental right for employers or sponsors to begin with. From an Islamic perspective; it is wrong for one person to have such control over another; man is free and should not be a slave to another. Islam has clear guidelines and parameters; one need only consult a scholar for ahadith and Qur'anic verses that would present support for an end to the practice of sponsorship in its current form. With a competitive system; employers would be forced into better treatment of their workers in order to retain their valued staff. The result will be a more contented workforce and better products; both of which are beneficial for the employer. The resistance to a change in the present legislation could only be construed as a worrisome fear that employers would actually have to provide things for their employees that; heretofore; they have been able to overlook; i.e.; proper living situations; salaries paid on time and in full; and the choice by an employee to stay or leave for a different position. No one wins when an undervalued employee is retained against his will. If Qatar is the new &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; for expats; it is also still the land of perceived slave owners who are unwilling to give up their grasp on the chains that bind their employees and keep them subservient. That grasp enables sponsors to keep their workers tied to them&#8212;but only until the employees have outlived their usefulness. There is no dignity to be found in an environment such as this. Slavery goes against human dignity and is also against the spirit of Islam. Qatar needs to fulfill its role as a leader in the region by setting a new standard&#8212;a standard of human rights that was established by Islam. Qatar has nothing to lose and everything to gain by eradicating this most detestable example of all human indignities; the modern day slavery that we call the sponsorship law.</RelQBody>

			<RelQSubject>Filipina killed in &#8216;OFW-friendly&#8217; Kuwait</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Another Filipina worker killed in &#8216;OFW-friendly&#8217; Kuwait JERRIE M. ABELLA; GMANews.TV 10/24/2010 | 10:55 PM The Philippine Embassy in Kuwait has confirmed that the decomposing body of a woman found over a week ago on the roof of a building in that small; oil-rich Middle Eastern country was that of a Filipina worker. Vice Consul Rea Oreta said; in a phone interview Sunday with GMANews.TV; that the victim was identified based on her passport as Jenny Dechosa; 33; from Misamis Oriental. &#8220;(Kuwait&#8217;s) Criminal Investigation Division (CID) has just confirmed to us that the victim was indeed a Filipina; and her case is now under investigation;" Oreta said. According to her; the CID likewise told the Embassy that an Egyptian national has been arrested in connection to the crime and is now detained at the Bayan Police Station. Oreta said the CID has refused to release more information on Dechosa&#8217;s case as it is considered &#8220;confidential;" but reports state the suspect was the victim&#8217;s lover. &#8220;Right now we are requesting the help of the OUMWA (Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs) to locate the family of Dechosa because all we have is her passport;" Oreta said. Missing since Oct. 10 A report by the Kuwait-based Arab Times said Dechosa&#8217;s body was found by police authorities on October 16 in between air-conditioning units on the roof of Hall No. 5 at the Kuwait International Fair grounds in Mishref. According to the report; Dechosa was working in a saloon in Salmiya and does part-time work as a house cleaner. Quoting Dechosa&#8217;s housemates; the report said the victim left their house on October 10; her rest day; for a part-time cleaning job in Mishref. She; however; reportedly backed out of the job as the house was too big and instead asked the taxi driver to drop her off a shopping mall where she was supposedly meeting someone. Dechosa was unable to go home that day; and six days after she was reported missing; a body of a woman in a state of decomposition was found in Mishref. On the same day; her employer and housemates confirmed that the body was indeed Dechosa&#8217;s through fingerprinting and other pieces of evidence; even as her face was reportedly unrecognizable as it seemed to have been smashed with a hard object; the Arab Times report said. A separate report on Arab Times on Saturday identified the suspect as the Egyptian caretaker of the building where Dechosa&#8217;s body was discovered. The report said the suspect was identified based on the victim&#8217;s mobile phone records. The suspect reportedly confessed he had an affair with Dechosa; and admitted killing her by hitting her with a metal rod on her head. The motive for the killing; however; remains unclear. According to Vice Consul Oreta; Dechosa&#8217;s remains may take at least a month to be repatriated; or as soon as the CID and the local prosecutor finish their investigation. OFW-friendly? The killing of Dechosa came three months after two other Filipinas were brutally killed in separate incidents in Kuwait; which has been identified by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs as one of the countries where the rights and welfare of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are protected. In July; a Filipina worker was tortured to death by her employer and then left in the desert; while another was stabbed dead at least 31 times by her Egyptian husband allegedly in a fit of jealousy. Government agencies have likewise repatriated Filipino workers from Kuwait by the hundreds in the last few months; majority of them household service workers who ran away from their sponsors for various reasons; such as labor contract violations and physical abuse; or are overstaying in the country. Oreta declined to comment if Kuwait&#8217;s classification as a safe country for migrant workers will be reviewed in light of the recent string of killings and abuses of Filipino laborers in the Middle East country. Kuwait ranks sixth in the top ten destinations of OFWs in 2009; with some 45;900 Filipino workers deployed there on the same year; according to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. Records from the Commission on Filipinos Overseas meanwhile show there are over 140;000 Filipinos in Kuwait as of 2008; only 500 of whom are considered permanent residents. &#8211; DM/KBK; GMANews.TV</RelQBody>

It should be illegal and should be banned by Qatari Government as it is messing up all our business needs.

			<RelQSubject>SupporT</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>TOKYO (Reuters Life!) - A Japanese lingerie maker Wednesday unveiled a bra that carries messages of encouragement from overseas as the country struggles to recover from a devastating quake and tsunami that struck exactly two months ago. The white; bustier-style garment and matching skirt by Triumph are covered with messages from 36 different countries received in the aftermath of the disaster; each accompanied by a tiny flag of the nation that sent it. Messages ranged from simple good wishes; such as "Japan; with you 100%" from France; to expressions of admiration for Japan's strength and dignity. Others were poignant. "Those who have already left us let us know life is so fragile; and those who are alive let us know life is so strong;" said one from China. The company; known for its concept designs; said it came up with the bra after receiving messages of support from branch companies around the world; along with relief supplies. The bra is not for sale. "I read each message myself; and I realized that everyone around the world is sending their support;" said 20-year-old Hikaru Kawai; who modeled the outfit. "So I decided that I needed to do my best as well." Nearly 26;000 people were killed or are unaccounted for after the disaster; which triggered the world's biggest nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986 -- and which a few messages couldn't resist alluding to. "Our thoughts are with you! Future without nuclear power; for our children!" read a message from Greece. Previous efforts from the company have included a solar-powered bra and a "Welcome to Japan" bra; which featured greetings in three different languages.
