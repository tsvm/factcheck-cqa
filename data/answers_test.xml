			<RelQSubject>Process to convert Family visit visa to Family Residence visa</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello All; I have my wife here in Qatar on family visit visa and planning to apply for family residence visa. Will I need all the documents again which were submitted for visit visa application; or just need to go to the Medical commission for medical and tell them I need to convert visit to residence visa and they will charge accordingly. I belive 500 for conversion and 100 for medical. and later 500 for RP</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>You have to apply for residence visa with further more documents. I think that only Main office Al Gharaffa (building no 3) accepts the application. The best option is ; have the medical test and extend the visit visa for 5 more months; then apply for residence visa. sometimes it may take longer time even you have all the documents and requirements. best of luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here's the complete process: 1. Go to Medical commission with the entry visa and get the medical done. The receipt will say "Visa Extension". You will be charged QAR 100 2. After 2 days check on medical commission URL. The result should say fit: http://www.sch.gov.qa/mcr/En/mcresults.jsp?CSRT=16143102073400656878 . 3. Go to immigration office with the application form and all the required documents; garrafa office gate number 4. Submit all the documents. Better go between 6 am to 9 am or 3 pm to 4 pm else you wont get the token. 4. After 4 days; check on MOI website for the status. If it says ready to print; then go to Immigration office garrafa again at gate 1 with the document submission receipt. http://www.moi.gov.qa/VsaWeb/Actions?action=getVisaapprovalInput&amp;language=English 5. You will be charged QAR 200 for converting visit visa to residence visa and QAR 500 for getting visa without exiting Qatar. Take the paper visa 6. Again go to Medical commission and show the paper visa and tell them you need to do medical to convert to residence visa. No need to take your family with you as no medical checkup will be done again. You will be charged QAR 100 again and the receipt will say purpose as 'Residence / Work visa'. Go to counter 64 where the officer will update his system so that the medical data will be sent to finger print office. 7. Go to finger print office at Mesaimer with all your receipts and get the finger prints done. Ensure to collect the finger print receipt 8. After 4 days again go to Immigration office at Garrafa at gate number 2 with all the documents and passport size photograph. If you forgot to get the finger print receipt then you will be directed to fill an application form. There is a counter available in gate 2 where the person was very helpful in filling out the form in arabic and giving all instructions. Also; make sure to have a blood group report with you of your wife from any medical clinic/hospital in Qatar. You will be charged QAR 500 for one year RP. Again Eyes scan will be required hence make sure to take your wife along with you. Be at the office between 6 am to 9 am or 3 pm to 4 pm. I had a lot of issues in getting all the above details. I hope this helps to others who are planning to convert their visit visa to residence permit.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>sis u can not sponsor ur son; labour office law dont allow mother to sponsor the children. ur husband should be the one to sponsor ur childrens here in doha. this is till my knowledge but if u have source in labour office then the situation can be different. bcos you need to get approval from labour office. you can ask someone to get the form from labour office and finish the requirments and submit in labour office. they will ask you for meeting in the labour office and then there are 60% chances that they will give u visa for ur son. but it will be little hard bcos labour office are very strict they might ask you why ur husband is not here in doha. so it will be complicated that time. pray and submit; GOD is only always opening windows for hope.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first thing u need to get letter from ur company showing how much is ur salary; which position u r working and they dont have problem that u will sponsor ur son. second thing u need to get statement from back for ur account for 6 months. third get salary certificate showing how much ur company is transfering ur salary to the bank. fouth get ur labour contract copy and plus ur offer letter copy also. fifth get the copy for electric and water bill (for the place u r staying). then get the form from labour office to apply family visa and ask some typist to type that form and then attached all those documents with that form and submit to labour office and hopefully u will get reply within 5 to 6 working days. all those documents are important.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Retaining the passports by the sponsor is not to be labelled as "Confiscation" rather it is to be under "safe control" by the HR dept.; In practical; many of the company's still practice holding passports of not only labors but staff also. Expatriates are the cause for this; they run away from the sponsor due to some reason; when you report to CID; you need to surrender expats PP also; this is why most of them collect PP from employees. In no way it should hurt an expat as long as he is under sponsor's magic stick.

			<RelQSubject>ambiguity on transfer of sponsorship</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Gud pm everyone; it was just confused regarding the transfer of sponsorship; because i came in here under my brother's sponsorship visit visa; then i found a job 1 week before my expiration; then the employer asked me for my passport to process my RP. I did my fingerprint and medical; and i saw that they have extended my visit visa. But im not sure if its still under my brother's sponsorship; because we went to the POLO and they told us that since my brother is the one who sponsored me going in here they need my brothers NOC; for me to be transferred to the sponsorship of the company; even though i already had my fingerprint and medical. Is it true? please i need help right now; im really confused.. Thanks in advance.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>You're still under your brothers' sponsorship; if you did not satisfy some of this requirements. 1. No objection letter coming from your brother written in arabic (take the service of translators in irani souq) it should be addressed to the immigration department; the letter should mention the name (company)of your prospective sponsor. 2. You've got to let your brother sign the change of sponsorship form which is available in immigration or other translator/type writting shops in doha. After all this requirements; your PRO or "mandoop" shall process this for you; it's good that you've finished the medical &amp; finger printing.

			<RelCText>Be tough man! nobody is allowed to withheld somebodys' passport except YOU! Ask them again; if you're passport has this visa sticker then they are your lawfull sponsors now! Under sponsorship law you cannot transfer your sponsorship within a year; so you have to wait. Tell them that you need your passport back otherwise you'll launch a complain to the police; there's a penalty (QAR 5;000) for sponsors withholding their personnel's passport.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>&lt;i&gt;if you are not under ur company's sponsorship then ur free and you can go to POLICE to claim your PASSPORT from them but if sponsorship is changed then you have no choice but to wait for 1 whole year. .

			<RelCText>Gud am guys; thanks for your replies; but we went to the ministry of labour and they told me that Im already under their sponsorship may 5th 2009; I also talked to the head of Philippine Labor; and they told me that It's possible since I'm only here on a visit visa; So I have no choice but to continue working on the medical software; anyway they've returned my passport and they told me that after I finished working on the software they would release me; give me exit permit and NOC; then I can come back here and under my brother's sponsorship again and apply for another job. Well that's life I think I should've signed the contract before I started working; btw I was asking them if I could sign the contract they told me that you can't sign the contract without the RP is this correct? And how long does it take to process an RP? I already finished my medical and fingerprint; 2 months ago. Thanks for the replies in advance.</RelCText>

What I know now is that a family visit status&#8217; validity varies and is eligible for extension upon request; is that right. May I ask how much does it costs(28days validity)? Any related information about it would be nice too&#8230;more power to all of you!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>first; NOC was NOT introduced recently! It has been for ages here! second; what NOC are you guys talking about; since smartkhan76 has never been to qatar before.. Third; and MAIN.. smartkhan76.. business visa is issued by the Comapnies to their consultants; temporary employees and visitors related to the company's business. NO ONE has rights 'to buy' a Business visa on the private basis; therefore the question "how much it will cost" is ILLEGAL! so relax and follow Mandy's advice: find a Job first; then come to qatar for work. I have got an idea! I have to start a business; based on the contract with the Governemtn of qatar; something like "private investigation office"; and to discover the Companies which issue illegal business visas and to find persons who buys illegal business Visas... i think it would be profitable.. &lt;i&gt; &lt;b&gt; ********************* &#8220;You become responsible forever for what you have tamed&#8221;.

			<RelCText>Yes; Qatarisun; smartkhan has been on QL several times before looking to "buy" a business visa so; he says; he can come and look for a job. He just doesn't believe us when we say that this is an unwise and illegal practice.

			<RelCText>In this case; you should exit the State within 1 week. Because; the Deportation Police will be calling the attention of your HR company and deportation should take place within 3-7days; that's their rules. You won't get any settlement from your Employer/Sponsor other than the number of hours/days you work with them for the last 15days. I presume; that you dont even have an Employment Contact signed yet with your company? Although confirmed return ticket back to your home country should be shouldered by your Employer/Sponsor; and it is strictly required from them by the Deportation Dept. May I ask you this;....did you have any idea regarding your illness at the time and prior to hiring? Were you been hired thru a Manpower Agency or Direct Hired?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Miss; Nice to see fast reply. Thank you very much for your support. Well things has been sort out when i spoke to my chairman. They paid me 15 days salary and also gave me one way ticket to Bombay. As i have no idea abt the labour law i was confused; anyway thanks to all of them who have help me regarding this issue. Well regarding your question; i was working in Dubai from last 3 yrs as HR Adminstrator in the reputed MNC. I am well versed in labour law in UAE. I did biggest mistake by leaving my pervious employer. I met present company MD in the conference meeting held in Dubai from my company in the month of Oct. He was impress with my work and gave me a good offer with atractive package. I accepted his offer and gave resignation. I went back to Bombay in the month of December end and he sent me the Emp. Visa in 3 days. Before leaving from Bombay i did my health check up and everything was normal and good. Allhumdullah. After reaching Qatar; things where out of immiganation..... Anyway i m going tonite to Bombay and have to start seaching for the new job. Hmmmm let see how things work out and what's next in my FATE. So Miss once again thank you very much. All the best.... Have fun and be cool...... Takecare !!!!</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>Am I allowed to live in Qatar?</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Salam. I was wondering... Am I allowed to live in Qatar by choice or can I only live there if I am hired to work there? I am looking into Muslim countries and a friend of mine recommended Qatar because it is not as crowded as other places and not as expensive either... also its not a tourism city. I will appreciate it if anyone can answer my question. Thanks.</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>To live in Qatar you have to have a sponsor; which means that you have to get a job; and they will send you a visit visa which will then be changed to work visa. By the way; this is how it works in all Gulf Area. Sorry could not bring happy news for you. Actually your question made me wonder; where some one like you would live; it is very hard to find a Muslim country that strictly follows the Islam principles. Good Luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I don't know who told you it's not an expensive place to live; but they're mistaken. Housing especially is expensive and the costs are rising. Today's newspaper headline was inflation hitting 17%. As you've been told already; you need a sponsor to live in Qatar which generally entails getting a job offer.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You need a visa and sponsor to live in Qatar. It depends on the sponsor if you have to work for him or not. It is not cheap in Qatar and it is a quite Islamic country but not very strcit. Things were different few years back. It was really cheap and it was having much more stricter Islamic rules. Now everything has been changed as it is more expensive compared to many other GCC countries and is not as strict as before.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Consider Malaysia or Brunei. I dunno whether they give residency without work visa but heard they r nice place to live; spcly Brunei and quite Islamic too. Anyways Gulf countries are not as Islamic as you expect it to be. I dnt think there is any country which is pure Islamic; coz there is no country in the world with just one religion. When you have many different religions; u need to give allowance to the non-muslims as well. So dnt expect any country to be pure Islamic. But its true that you can look for quite an Islamic environment to live in; easier to safegaurd your Eman. May Allah guid u to the right place.</RelCText>
